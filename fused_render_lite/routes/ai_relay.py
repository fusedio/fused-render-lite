# --- /api/ai — inference through the Claude Code CLI --------------------------
#
# fused.ai.text({prompt, ...opts}) lands here. The shell invokes the `claude` binary the
# user already has (Claude Code — its login is the credential) rather than
# pages fetching a model directly: the page stays origin-clean (no API key or
# endpoint baked into authored HTML), and the server is one place to grow
# config/limits later. Wire shape is the house {ok, result,
# error:{type,message}} contract /api/run set; {"stream": true} switches the
# response to NDJSON chunks (see _ai_relay).
#
# The CLI is driven as a bare completion engine: --tools= disables every
# built-in tool, --setting-sources= skips user/project settings and
# CLAUDE.md, --system-prompt-file REPLACES the shipped agent prompt, and
# --no-session-persistence keeps everything off disk.
#
# LATENCY (D168/D169): the CLI is a Node program whose startup alone costs
# ~1.5-2.5s — it dominated every call at haiku sizes. ONE persistent process
# is therefore kept alive in --input-format stream-json mode and RECONFIGURED
# per request over its stdin protocol (all probed on 2.1.220):
#   /clear (a plain user message)        -> wipes conversation context, ~0.7s
#   set_model control_request            -> swaps model AND system_prompt, ~0ms
#   set_max_thinking_tokens ctrl_request -> 0 clamps thinking on ANY model,
#                                           null resets to session default
#   apply_flag_settings control_request  -> sets effortLevel, ~10ms
# Every call therefore sees an empty context (the /clear is what preserves
# D159's isolation property), and only the first call after a crash or server
# start pays a spawn. Requests are SERIALIZED through the one process (a
# local single-user app; calls are seconds) rather than pooled.

# `effort` medium/high/xhigh passes through to Claude Code's own effort
# semantics (the same code path as the interactive /effort command) — only
# effort-capable models (sonnet/opus class) honor effortLevel. Absent or
# "low" means NO THINKING, enforced with the thinking-budget clamp, which
# works on every model including haiku (the default, which otherwise thinks
# by default in stream-json mode). See _AiSession.configure.

# A cloud alias ("opus") or a Hugging Face repo id ("mlx-community/Qwen3-8B-4bit").
# The slash is the SEAM (SPEC §40): a model id with an org in it names a repo on
# disk, which means local inference, and one without it is a Claude alias. That
# is not a heuristic — a Hub id always has the form `org/name`, and no Claude
# alias ever contains a slash — and it is what lets `fused.ai.text({prompt,
# model})` reach a local model with no `provider` spelled out. Since D631
# the shape rule is the DEFAULT, not the only route: an explicit `provider`
# pins the tier and this function is not consulted.
#
# **The seam gained a second shape (D411) and this is the one place it has to
# be spelled out, because it is genuinely not a slash-shaped id.**
# `llamacpp-text`'s curated ids (`formats.GGUF_RECIPES`) are the GGUF's own
# FILENAME, never a repo id — `"Qwen3.5-4B-Q4_K_M.gguf"` has no `/` at all —
# because a GGUF repo commonly ships two dozen quantizations of one model and
# the filename is what tells them apart (see `llama_text.py`'s own docstring).
# `"/" in model` alone therefore sent every curated llamacpp id down the
# CLAUDE path, as an unrecognised alias, which nothing caught because nothing
# had called `fused.ai()` with one — a bug from the moment `llamacpp-text`
# shipped (D411), not something Piece 1/2 introduced, found while auditing
# this file for what the branch invalidated. No Claude alias has ever ended
# in `.gguf` either, so the fix is the same kind of fact as the slash: an

    A shim can only be started through cmd.exe, and the naive form of that is
    the argv list ["cmd.exe", "/c", bin_path, *args]. It does not work.
    Windows has no argv: CreateProcess takes a command line, which asyncio
    builds with subprocess.list2cmdline, quoting each element that needs it.
    cmd.exe preserves that inner quoting only when the rest of its line holds
    exactly TWO quote characters; a shim path with spaces plus any quoted
    argument makes four, cmd falls through to its strip-the-outermost-pair
    rule and re-splits at the spaces — so a `C:\\Users\\John Doe\\...` install

    returns a string and is spawned as a command line instead (see
    _spawn_claude_stream), which CPython wraps as `comspec /c "<payload>"` — one
    outer quote pair around a payload in which every element is quoted. cmd
    then strips exactly that outer pair and reads the rest as written.

    Every element is quoted, not only the ones with spaces: the outer pair
    stops cmd re-parsing QUOTES, not metacharacters (& | > < ^), and a quoted

    see configure). All probed on claude 2.1.220.

    Requests are SERIALIZED by `lock`: a second concurrent fused.ai call
    waits for the first. Accepted tradeoff — this is a local single-user app,
    calls complete in seconds, and one flat ~350MB Node process beats a
    spawn-per-call churn where every config change paid a 2s cold start.

    Health: a dead instance (crash, auth expiry) is respawned on the next
    request; a request that finds the instance wedged (control timeout,
    write failure) kills it and retries once on a fresh spawn. If a future
    CLI drops the set_model system_prompt field, that same path degrades
    gracefully: the control error triggers a respawn whose argv carries the
    requested config."""

    `_images_problem` only checks the shape of the list; this checks whether
    the request means anything at all once it reaches a worker. Only
    `mlx-text`'s own worker reads `images` (`mlx_text/worker.py`'s image
    branch, which builds the prompt through `mlx_vlm.prompt_utils.
    apply_chat_template`) — `llamacpp_text`'s shared `generate` (`runners/
    llama_text.py`) reads `messages`/`prompt`/the sampling knobs and nothing
    else, so a picture handed to it is silently dropped on the floor. That
    would read as a confident answer about nothing on Linux, on Windows, or
    on a Mac where llama.cpp has been promoted over MLX — not a 400, not a
    warning, just an answer about a photograph the model never saw.

    `_accepts_image` (`ai_runtime.py`, AI-11j) already knows this — it is the
    SAME computation the catalog's attach affordance is drawn from, both the
    engine gate and, for `mlx-text`, whether the specific checkpoint even has
    a vision tower — so it is asked here rather than re-derived: a caller
    that ignores the flag, or a client built before it existed, must not get
    an answer the flag never promised.

    the body carries {"stream": true} — an NDJSON StreamingResponse of
    {"type":"chunk","text"} lines closed by a {"type":"done"} line. All
    validation happens BEFORE any streaming starts, so 400s and the
    binary-missing 502 are always proper JSON; only an error after the first
    byte is demoted to an ok:false done frame on a 200.

    `session` is the calling app's own `_AiSession` (its `app.state.ai_session`,
    set by `prewarm_ai(app)`) — read ONCE here, at the top, and threaded
    through the whole request. That single read (rather than several reads
    of the `_AI_SESSION` module global spread across the queued check, the
    lock acquire and every configure/_discard call below) is what keeps one
    request pinned to one session even if another app build reassigns the
    global while this request is in flight. Callers with no app handle
    (direct module-level calls, tests) fall back to `_AI_SESSION`.

    `page` is the calling page (`X-Fused-Page`, read and unquoted by
    `api_ai` the same way `routers/jobs.py` and `routers/capture.py` do) —
    threaded to whichever tier answers, so its own Activity row knows where
    a click on it should go. The Claude tier falls back to `/claude-config`
    when there is none: unlike local/apple, that row has no other page a
    caller reliably supplies (a direct module-level call, or a test, may

    same 409 for a model that is not ready — so a page that swaps
    `model: "mlx-community/…"` for `provider: "apple"` changes nothing else,
    including `page`, the calling page's own `X-Fused-Page`.

    Differences that are the framework's, not this relay's: `usage` is null
    on macOS 26 (the API reports no token counts until 27), and a guardrail
    refusal is not an error but a `finishReason` of `"content-filter"` — the
    AI SDK's name — with whatever text was produced before the classifier
    vetoed it. Cancellation reaches the helper on the ✕ (polled between
