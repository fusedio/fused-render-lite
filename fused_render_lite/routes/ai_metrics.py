"""What `/api/ai` has done in THIS process: tokens, speed, failures (SPEC AI-12).

A local counter for a local question. `fused.ai` is the one place in this app
that spends model time — a page's chat box, the commit-message call, a
generation from a resident local model — and until now the only trace it left
was one line per call in the app log. "Is the thing I just wrote hammering the
model?", "how fast is this model on this laptop?" and "are my AI calls even
working?" had no answer at all.

Four counters, because volume alone answers only the first of those:

* **Tokens and completions**, bucketed over time — the graph.
* **Failures, by kind** — a page whose calls all time out has generated zero
  tokens, which is the same picture as a page nobody opened until the failures
  are counted beside them. A model that is merely still LOADING is not one of
  them: that call started a download and said so.
* **Seconds spent generating**, and the tokens/second that falls out of it —
  the number anybody choosing between two local models actually wants, and the
  explanation when a model on the CPU (AI-11b) "feels broken".
* **Which tier**, Claude or a local model, on the `/`-in-the-id seam AI-1
  already defines — because this page's whole subject is the local half, and a
  total that merged the two would answer neither question.

Three properties, and each one is a deliberate NON-feature:

* **In memory, in this process.** Nothing is written to disk and nothing
  survives a restart, so this is not a usage ledger, cannot be reconciled
  against a bill, and never becomes a file somebody has to prune. `since` in
  every snapshot says exactly which window the numbers cover, so a restarted
  server reads as "counting from 00:04" rather than as a machine that
  generated nothing today.
* **Bounded by construction.** A fixed ring of `BUCKETS` slots and at most
  `MAX_MODELS` per-model rows: the store is the same handful of kilobytes after
  one call and after a million, with no pruning pass to get wrong.
* **It counts what the CALLER was told.** `record()` takes the very `usage`
  dict the relay is about to put on the wire, so the graph can never disagree
  with the number the page read off its own response. A tier that reports no
  usage contributes a completion and no tokens rather than an estimate — this
  module never tokenizes anything itself, because a count derived from the text
  would be a different number wearing the same label.

What is NOT counted, deliberately: a completion nobody finished (a client that
went away mid-response) — only the terminal frame carries a token count, so
there is nothing honest to add; a request refused as malformed, which never
reached a model at all; and Claude Code sessions started elsewhere in the app
(the `claude` chat template, the task runner). Those are the user's own Claude
Code session spending the user's own budget through a CLI that reports it; this
file is about the API this app serves.
