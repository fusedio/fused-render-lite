"""GET /api/ai/runtime, /api/ai/catalog and the load/unload/download POSTs —
what this machine is running locally (SPEC §40).

The other half of `/api/ai`. That endpoint answers "complete this prompt"; these
answer "which model, held where, costing what" — the questions that only exist
once inference is local and a model is a resident process rather than a request
to somebody else's datacentre.

Four routes and one rule each:

* `GET /api/ai/runtime` — what is loaded, what each is costing in resident bytes,
  and which runners this machine can even use. In-memory plus one health probe
  per live worker, so the sidebar can poll it.
* `POST /api/ai/runtime/load` — make a model resident. Returns a JOB ID
  immediately; a cold load is a multi-GB download and nothing waits on it. A
  `capability` left out is INFERRED from what the repo is, never defaulted —
  see `_inferred_capability`, and D321 for the bug that made it so.
* `POST /api/ai/runtime/unload` — release the weights.
* `POST /api/ai/runtime/download` — fetch without loading, for the AI Models
  page, where the verb is "Download" and the user is not asking to run anything
  yet.

Plus the three routes that make a capability DO something rather than be
resident: `POST /api/ai/image`, `POST /api/ai/transcribe` and
`POST /api/ai/video`. All three answer with a job id and a path, because all
three run for minutes (video: potentially hours — see `supervisor.
VIDEO_TIMEOUT_S`) and all three produce a file.

The POSTs mutate — they start processes and write gigabytes — so every one of
them carries the D3 `X-Fused` guard. The reads do not, like every other read in
the app.

    grid (`snap_output_dimensions(..., two_stage=True)` in
    `ltx-pipelines-mlx`), coarser than the app's ordinary 32-multiple video
    rail (`_VIDEO_SIDE_STEP`). Landing on that grid already means the
    engine's own re-snap is a no-op, so the width/height this route echoes
    back are the ones actually rendered.

    The longest side is fit to the ENGINE's own longer default side
    (`max(traits.default_width, traits.default_height)`), not the image
    route's 1024 — that figure is that route's own tuned default and has
    nothing to do with video. The pixel budget is enforced in 64-steps here
    (not `_clamp_video_canvas`'s ordinary 32), so a canvas this function
    hands back never needs a further shave that would knock it back off the
    64-multiple grid.

    **This is NOT the same fit-without-upscaling arithmetic as
    `_edit_default_size`, despite starting from the identical shape — the
    step is 4x coarser (64 against 16) against the SAME 256 floor, so aspect
    collapses far more readily.** `_edit_default_size` only overrides aspect
    on an extreme ratio (a 4000x200 banner). Here, ANY reference whose short
    side lands under 320 after fitting gets that side floored to 256
    regardless of ratio, so an ordinary small or near-square photo can come
    back perfectly square: a 300x200 (3:2) reference is not downscaled at all

    64) == 256` — landing on 256x256 for a picture that was never square.
    This is accepted, not a bug to route around: the 64-multiple floor is
    what keeps the reply honest about the engine's own re-snap grid, and
    holding it, not the aspect ratio, is what this function exists for.

    4. …except when the repo IS on disk and nothing here reads it. That is the

    capability is NOT enough to put a repo in a list: `catalog.SUGGESTIONS` is keyed
    by runner precisely because one capability's backends read mutually unloadable
    formats (AI-11a), and a cached repo injected on its capability alone would break
    that invariant inside the very same array. `openai/whisper-large-v3` is a speech
    model that neither shipping speech runner reads; `mlx-community/Qwen3-8B-MLX-4bit`
    is a text model that llama.cpp cannot open, so on a Mac switched to
    llama.cpp it is an unusable download. So the test is the FORMAT's own answer —
    is the runner this row resolved among the ones that would accept this snapshot
    (`CachedModel.loaders`)? — and anything else is left out of `models[]` entirely.

    **Left out, not flagged.** `models[]` has no `available`/`reason` field and every
    consumer reads it as "things I may offer"; adding one would mean every existing
    picker keeps offering the unloadable repo until it learns a new key, which is the
    failure being fixed rather than a fix. The repo is not hidden — the AI Models
    page's Local tab is the surface for "what is on my disk", it lists the repo, and
    it already prints WHICH engine reads it and what stands in the way ("text
    generation is set to llama.cpp (CPU), which does not read this format — switch
    it on the Engines tab"). A picker cannot say that; a card can.

    **Cached entries are APPENDED.** `entry.default`, `catalog.default_for()` and
    `catalog.for_capability()` keep answering over the curated list alone — read
    catalog.py's docstring on why smallest-first with the default at position 0 is
    deliberate. A bare `fused.ai.transcribe()` therefore still loads a vetted model
    rather than whatever 20GB experiment is on the disk, and the tail is sorted by the
    same rule so the two halves read as one list. **The one case where a cached entry
    reaches index 0 is a runner with no `SUGGESTIONS` key at all**, where there is
    nothing curated to put in front of it; `default` is then None, which is the
    honest answer, and `source` is on every entry so that a consumer inventing a
    `models[0]` fallback can refuse an uncurated one. Read `default`, never `models[0]`.

    Two additive fields make the states tellable apart without a second request:
    `source` ("curated" | "cached") says which half an entry came from, and
    `downloaded` says whether it is on this disk — so a curated entry can be marked
    downloaded and is not duplicated as a cached one. `loaded` is read live from the
    supervisor rather than from the memoised scan, because residency changes on a
    second's notice and the disk inventory does not.

    `recommended` is a THIRD, and it is the curation's own second axis rather than
    anything this join computes: True on the subset of curated entries a person
    marked as a first thing to try, always False on a cached one — nobody wrote a
    recommendation for a repo the user found themselves, the same reason `note` is
    null there. Normalised to a bool on both halves so a consumer can filter on it
    without reading absence as an answer; the Playground draws
    recommended-or-on-disk and every other picker keeps reading the whole list
    (D425).

    **One runner's curated ids are FILENAMES, not repo ids, and this function is
    where that stops being invisible.** `formats.GGUF_RECIPES` keys
    `llamacpp-text`'s catalog entries by the GGUF's own filename — the module
    docstring there explains why a repo id alone cannot address one of a
    repo's several curated quantizations — so `entry["id"] in on_disk`
    (a set of REPO ids) can never be true for one of those entries: a
    downloaded `Qwen3.5-9B-Q4_K_M.gguf` showed "Download" forever, while the
    same bytes appeared a SECOND time as a plain "cached" row keyed by
    `unsloth/Qwen3.5-9B-GGUF`, whose Load button then failed (that repo id is
    not itself a `GGUF_RECIPES` key). `hub_cache.is_downloaded` resolves a
    filename-keyed entry through the recipe's `(repo, file)` pair and
    `CachedModel.files` (the snapshot's own filenames) instead of a set of repo
    ids alone — and it lives THERE rather than here because the Benchmark tab's
    "is this model on this machine" guard needs the identical answer, and the
    copy it wrote instead admitted every curated id;
    `curated_repo_ids` then removes the SAME repo from the "cached"
    tail below whenever any of ITS curated entries resolved as downloaded, so
    the two halves cannot show the one download twice under two different ids.

    **`repo` puts that same translation ON THE WIRE, because a client cannot
    redo it.** Every entry carries the repo id whose cache folder holds it —
    equal to `id` everywhere but a filename-keyed one, where it is the recipe's
    `repo`. The Local tab has the identical duplicate to avoid and no way to
    avoid it: its "do I already have a card for this" map is keyed by repo id
    (`/api/ai-models`, the page's own walk), so `LFM2.5-1.2B-Instruct-Q4_K_M.gguf`
    never matched `LiquidAI/LFM2.5-1.2B-Instruct-GGUF` and the row kept its
    Download button beside its own finished disk card — the same "Download
    forever" this docstring describes, one layer up and still open. It cannot
    read `downloaded` instead (`mergeSections` states why: two definitions of
    on-disk on one page are two moments they were true), so what it needs is the
    IDENTITY, not the verdict. A field rather than a client-side table for the
    reason `GGUF_RECIPES` is server-side at all: which repo publishes a curated
    quantization is the curation's fact, and a second copy in TypeScript is one
    that goes stale the next time a recipe's repo changes.

    loaded only a checkpoint's language tower and the vision half of every MLX

    on demand, only when a request actually attaches an image — so a
    TEXT_GENERATION entry is a real candidate here too, provided the
    checkpoint it names actually has a tower to feed one to.

    Two branches, one principle kept from before: **computed, never curated,
    and False rather than True-by-vacancy.**

    - IMAGE_GENERATION — unchanged, and still a mirror of `api_ai_image`'s own
      two refusals in the same order, so a picker's attach button and the
      route that would 400 the resulting request cannot disagree: the ENGINE
      (`engine_options` is the one place that says which backends honour
      `image`) and then the MODEL (mflux additionally needs an edit variant
      class named for the repo, `formats.mflux_edit_recipe`, since a repo can
      render and not edit).
    - TEXT_GENERATION — True only when the resolved runner is `mlx-text` (the
      one runner here that reads a checkpoint through mlx-vlm at all — a
      llama.cpp GGUF text model has no vision tower to speak of and must come
      back False the same as before) AND the checkpoint has a vision tower.
      **Two sources, in precedence order (SPEC AI-17 item 17):**
      `hub_cache.has_vision_tower` first, reading straight off an already-
      cached snapshot's own `config.json` with no model load involved — the
      MEASURED answer, when there is a snapshot to measure. Only when
      `hub_cache.has_cached_snapshot` says there is NOTHING on disk yet does
      this fall back to `hub_metadata.cached(model_id)`'s `hasVisionTower` —
      the Hub's OWN `config.json`, harvested ahead of any download (AI-17)
      — so a search result still classifies before the user fetches a
      single byte. `cached()`, never `get()` (code review finding 1): this
      is a route the picker polls, and `get()` is a synchronous `urllib`
      fetch with an 8-second timeout — `supervisor.start_hub_metadata_
      refresh`'s background sweep is the only thing that ever calls `get()`
      now, so this route only ever reads what that sweep already wrote,
      with no network access of its own. A cached snapshot that genuinely
      has no tower is never second-guessed by a stale Hub reading: "cannot
