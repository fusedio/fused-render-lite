"""What local inference this machine can do, and which folder does it (SPEC §40).

A **runner** is a folder holding a `pyproject.toml` and a `worker.py`. That is the
whole of it — the same shape `templates/zarr_aoi/` uses for its tile daemon, and
for the same reason: the model runs in its OWN interpreter, built from its own
declaration, in its own process.

Three things follow from that, and they are the reasons this is a folder rather
than an import:

* **fused-render's venv never grows torch or mlx.** They are multi-GB and
  platform-specific; a file explorer that could not start without them would be a
  worse file explorer. The runner's `pyproject.toml` is the only place they are
  named, and `envinstall` (PY-18) builds it on first use — the same detached
  `uv sync` with the same progress record and the same verbatim errors that every
  other declaring folder gets. No new install machinery exists for AI.
* **A wedged model cannot take the app down.** OOM, a CUDA fault, a Rust panic
  inside a loader — all of it happens in a process the supervisor can kill.
* **Adding a backend is adding a folder — and REMOVING one is removing a
  folder.** This was written when MLX was the only text runner and predicted a
  cross-platform runner "tomorrow"; that turned out to be exactly one new row
  here and one new folder (D293, transformers), and the llama.cpp rows below cost
  the same (D411). D416 then took the transformers family back OUT, and the
  reverse direction held too: three folders, three rows, and the ripple was in
  the CATALOG and the PROSE rather than in any mechanism. The claim is kept
  because it has now been tested in both directions.

**Availability is checked, never assumed.** MLX runs on Apple Silicon and nowhere
else, so `available()` answers with a REASON rather than a bool — "needs Apple
Silicon (this is linux/x86_64)" is something a page can show, while a silently
missing capability is something a user files a bug about.

Resolution is by CAPABILITY, not by model: a caller asks for `text-generation`
and gets whichever runner serves it here. A model id never picks the runner,
because the same repo can be servable by two backends and the choice belongs to
the machine, not to the string.

**Several runners can share one capability, and the ORDER between them is the
whole mechanism.** Text generation prefers MLX on Apple Silicon and uses torch
on Windows and Linux, with torch also remaining a fallback on Apple Silicon when
MLX is unavailable; speech to text does the same thing with MLX Whisper over
CTranslate2 (D319 briefly added a third row, Parakeet-TDT, and D406 withdrew it
— maintenance cost not justified by use — leaving the two rows below). Every
row is registered, every one is asked whether it can run, and the first that
says yes wins. Nothing else in the app knows there is more than
one — but the CATALOG does, because what to suggest depends on which backend
will load it (`catalog.py`), and an MLX checkpoint on a Windows machine is a
download that cannot be used.

**A user can override that order, and the override is a REQUEST rather than an
instruction** (D302). `resolve()` reads a per-capability preference — "auto", or
a runner code — from `shell/prefs.py`, and a named runner wins only if it can
actually run here. An honoured preference is the whole story; an override naming
a runner this machine cannot run is IGNORED and the ordering above decides, with
the reason carried out in the `Resolution` so a page can say what happened. That
asymmetry is the point: prefs.json travels — it is a plain file in a home
directory people sync, copy between machines and restore from a backup — so a
preference set on a Mac must not arrive on a Windows box and take speech to text
away entirely. A preference that quietly does nothing is recoverable; a
capability that has silently vanished is a bug report.

# One capability per runner for now. The constants are the vocabulary the whole

TEXT_GENERATION = "text-generation"
IMAGE_GENERATION = "text-to-image"
#: The Hub's own tag for it, like `IMAGE_GENERATION` is — so the constant, the
#: `pipeline_tag` on a Whisper repo and the capability a card asks to load are
#: one string rather than three that have to be kept in step.
SPEECH_TO_TEXT = "automatic-speech-recognition"
#: Vectors, not words: one model that turns a piece of text — or, where the
#: checkpoint has a vision tower, an image — into a point in one space, so a page
#: can compare them.
#:
#: **TWO MODEL SHAPES under one capability, which no other row here has.** A
#: DUAL ENCODER (SigLIP, CLIP) projects text and pictures into the same space and
#: answers `paths`; a PROSE ENCODER (BERT-family, 512 to 8192 tokens) answers
#: text alone and is what makes RAG, document search and clustering possible —
#: impossible on a dual encoder at any chunk size, since a SigLIP text tower
#: truncates at 64 tokens. `formats.DUAL_EMBED_MODEL_TYPES` and
#: `formats.TEXT_EMBED_MODEL_TYPES` are the two halves, and both engines here
#: serve both.
#:
#: **So `paths` and `kind` are PER-MODEL rather than per-capability**, and that
#: is the design consequence: the route refuses `paths` for a model with no
#: vision tower and `kind` for a model with no retrieval convention, each with a
#: 400 naming the model — the shape `_accepts_image` already uses for text
#: generation. A capability-level answer would have to be the union (offer
#: everything, fail inside a worker) or the intersection (offer neither, and the
#: image half of this capability disappears).
#:
#: **This capability was split until this branch, and the split is what got
#: reversed.** A separate `embed-text` capability meant two resident slots on a
#: machine that has budget for one, two catalogs, two bridge calls and two sets
#: of docs, to serve one question — "turn this into a vector" — whose answer
#: differs only in whether the checkpoint has a second tower.
#:
#: **It is also the one capability reached by MANY Hub tags**
#: (`ai/tasks.py`): `zero-shot-image-classification` for a dual encoder,
#: `feature-extraction` and `sentence-similarity` for a prose one. The plain
#: English name rather than any of them, unlike `SPEECH_TO_TEXT` above, and for
#: two reasons that both still hold: `zero-shot-image-classification` describes
#: one thing you can DO with these vectors rather than what the runner returns,
#: and no single tag covers both shapes. A future `reranking` capability sits
#: beside this one without renaming it.
EMBEDDINGS = "embeddings"
#: The Hub's own tag, like `IMAGE_GENERATION` and `SPEECH_TO_TEXT` are — a
#: diffusers text-to-video pipeline's `_class_name` folds onto "video
#: generation" (`hub_cache.py`'s `_diffusers_task`), and that label maps here.
#: The FIRST capability with no "everywhere" row: its only engine is MLX, so
#: unlike text/image/speech/embeddings there is no cross-platform fallback —
#: off Apple Silicon this capability has zero runners able to serve it, and
#: `catalog()` reports `default: null` for it there.

# -- the accelerator probes ------------------------------------------------------

# CUDA and ROCm are OPT-IN rows (the CPU torch runners sit above them and remain
# the default), and both probes are HARD GATES: an accelerated row is selectable
# only where it can actually run. That is not fastidiousness — picking one on a
# machine with no matching device buys a multi-gigabyte wheel that then fails
# several frames inside a runtime library, which is exactly the "advertising is
# a claim" failure `Runner.available` was written for.
#
# **Everything below reads the KERNEL's answer, and reads it at CALL time.**
# Every path is a module-level constant so a test can build a fake sysfs on a
# tmp_path and repoint them — the filesystem analogue of the `registry.platform`
# monkeypatching every other availability test does.
#
# **Stdlib only, no torch, no subprocess.** This module is imported on a page
# render path (`describe`, `describe_engines`, and every `resolve`), so it may
# not import a 2GB framework to ask a question sysfs answers in microseconds,
# and it may not shell out: SPEC.md's ffmpeg rule bars relying on a system
# binary the app does not ship, `nvidia-smi` is not shipped, and a cold one
# costs 50-500ms against ~25µs for the sysfs walk.

#: Where the ROCm probe looks. `/sys/class/kfd` is the amdkfd driver's own
#: topology — the same thing ROCm's runtime enumerates — and `/dev/kfd` plus a

    container restart, a driver reloaded — all fixed while the app runs).

    **Three shapes of NVIDIA machine, and only one of them has device nodes.**
    Ordinary Linux has `/dev/nvidiactl` + `/dev/nvidia[0-9]*`; WSL2 has neither
    and works anyway (`/dev/dxg`, and the driver's `libcuda.so.1` under
    `/usr/lib/wsl/lib`); Windows has no nodes at all and is gated on the
    driver's own DLL. Absence of the Linux nodes is therefore not evidence
    against WSL2, which is why that branch is asked FIRST rather than as a
    fallback after a refusal has already been written.

    **No `nvidia-smi`.** SPEC.md's rule about system binaries the app does not
    ship, and a cold `nvidia-smi` is 50-500ms on a per-page-render path against
    ~25µs of `os.access`.

    **No driver-version floor.** The floor belongs to the CUDA the runner's
    wheel pins, this module cannot read that from a file it does not have, and
    guessing high disables machines that work. The wheel's own error is the
    better reporter of a driver that is genuinely too old.

    **That trade is now made at DEFAULT-SELECTION level too, since the
    GPU-first policy decision (code review finding).** Before this row could
    lead its capability, a too-old driver's failure only reached someone who
    had picked CUDA deliberately from the Engines tab — now `auto` can hand
    it to an NVIDIA box on a first-run load, behind the multi-gigabyte
    accelerated download, with no chance to back out first. Still acceptable
    for the same reason `llamacpp-text`'s own corrupt-wheel comment gives for
    an analogous risk: the failure is LOUD and at install/load — `uv sync` or
    `import torch` reports the driver mismatch verbatim — not a wrong answer
    served quietly later. Adding a floor here to soften that would reintroduce
    exactly the guessing-disables-working-machines cost the paragraph above
    already rejects; the download size is the one part of this trade a driver

def _vulkan() -> Availability:
    """`llamacpp-text-vulkan`'s supported platforms and usable devices — one
    gate, unlike `_cuda`/`_rocm` beside it, because this row's own wheel
    tag set (installability, `_llamacpp_platform`'s question) and its usable
    hardware (`_cuda`/`_rocm`'s question) are BOTH narrower than anything else
    in this table, and answering them separately would need two functions
    that always run together.

    **The published wheel exists on exactly two platforms.** The vulkan index
    (`llamacpp_text_vulkan/pyproject.toml`) publishes `manylinux2014_x86_64`
    and `win_amd64` for `0.3.29` and NOTHING else — no macOS build at all
    (Apple Silicon already gets GPU acceleration through the CPU index's
    Metal-linked wheel, which is the whole reason this variant exists only
    for NVIDIA/AMD), no Linux aarch64, no Windows ARM64. Checked by
    architecture per OS exactly as `_llamacpp_platform` now is, and for the
    same reason: `system in ("Windows", "Linux")` alone would advertise a
    Load button on a Windows ARM64 box or a Linux aarch64 one, neither of
    which this specific index ships a wheel for.

    **A wheel existing is not the same question as it being USABLE, and this
    gate answers both because a Vulkan wheel supplies neither the loader nor
    the driver ICD — those come from the GPU driver, not from `pip`.** Two
    facts, established directly against the downloaded `0.3.29` wheels rather
    than assumed, decide how strict each half of the check must be:

    1. **The loader is a HARD link dependency, not a `dlopen`.** The wheel's
       own `libggml-vulkan.so` declares `DT_NEEDED libvulkan.so.1` (read
       straight out of its ELF `.dynamic` section), and `libggml.so` and
       `libllama.so` both declare `DT_NEEDED libggml-vulkan.so.0` in turn — so
       the whole chain fails to load, and `import llama_cpp` raises, the
       moment the loader is missing, regardless of whether a GPU is even
       asked about. The Windows DLL carries the identical dependency
       (`ggml-vulkan.dll` imports `vulkan-1.dll`, read from its PE import
       table), so the same hard-failure fact holds on both platforms this
       row ships for. This is why a MISSING LOADER is refused here rather
       than left to the worker's own error the way `_cuda`'s driver-version
       floor is: `_cuda`/`_rocm`'s missing-device case still lets `import
       torch` succeed and fail later inside a CUDA/HIP call, while a missing
       Vulkan loader here fails at the very first `import`, which is a worse
       and more confusing failure to hand back than a `Runner.available`
       reason string that names the actual cause.
    2. **A missing ICD (no GPU driver registered) is NOT a load failure —
       ggml's backend loader falls back to ITS OWN bundled CPU backend**
       (`libggml-cpu.so`/`ggml-cpu.dll`, present in both wheels alongside the
       74MB Vulkan one) when Vulkan enumerates zero devices, so `import
       llama_cpp` succeeds and inference still runs, just on the CPU. That
       is not a reason to pass the gate anyway: a machine in that state gets
       every byte of an 8x larger download (182MB vs. the CPU index's
       22.5MB Linux wheel) for the SAME CPU-only outcome the smaller
       `llamacpp-text` row already offers, which is exactly the "advertising
       a claim that buys nothing" case `_cuda`/`_rocm`'s device checks
       already exist to refuse.

    Both facts were established by parsing the actual `0.3.29` wheels
    (`zipfile` for the contents, a small ELF/PE parser for the dependency
    tables) on 2026-08-21 — not by reading ggml's source or assuming dynamic
    backend loading behaves like a plugin system, which it does NOT here: the
    Vulkan backend is linked in, not `dlopen`ed at runtime.

    **A registered ICD is not the same claim as a GPU, and the GPU-first
    reorder is what makes the difference matter (code review finding).** This
    function's own earlier revision argued a loose "any `*.json` present"
    check was fine BECAUSE `auto` could never reach this row — a user picking
    it explicitly from the Engines tab had already accepted whatever showed
    up. That argument is gone now that this row LEADS `llamacpp-text` in
    `_RUNNERS`: Mesa's lavapipe registers `lvp_icd.<arch>.json` under
    `mesa-vulkan-drivers`, which stock Ubuntu/Debian desktops ship alongside
    every hardware ICD, so a machine with **no GPU at all** still has a
    `*.json` here — and `auto` would hand it the 182MB Vulkan wheel for
    inference on llvmpipe, materially SLOWER than the 22.5MB CPU wheel behind
    it. So the Linux half of this gate now REFUSES when every ICD manifest
    found is a known software rasterizer (`SOFTWARE_VULKAN_ICD_MARKERS`,
    matched against the manifest FILENAME the same way the loader's own
    directory search works — not by opening and parsing the JSON, which would
    need trusting a driver-supplied file's schema this module has no reason
    to depend on). A hardware ICD sitting beside a software one still passes
    — lavapipe is a fallback Mesa registers unconditionally, so plenty of
    real GPU machines have both, and refusing there would disqualify a
    working GPU over an unrelated fallback entry.

    **Windows now gets an adapter check layered on top of the DLL hint, not
    a replacement for it (code review follow-up).** The loader call is still
    ruled out for the same reason as before: `vkCreateInstance`/
    `vkEnumeratePhysicalDevices` genuinely initializes the loader and every
    registered ICD, which is exactly the kind of call `hw_detect.py`'s own
    module docstring keeps off any path that runs per page-render/per
    resolve, and this module's own header ("stdlib only, no subprocess")
    rules out doing that call in a short-lived subprocess the way a
    slow/risky probe belongs (`hw_detect.py` draws precisely that line
    already). An in-process call that could hang or crash the server on a
    bad ICD is still worse than the check it would replace — that half of
    the earlier reasoning holds. But it only rules out the LOADER question,
    and this row's `_directml` neighbour already answered a narrower
    question — "is there a real display adapter, or only Microsoft's
    software one?" — without going anywhere near the loader:
    `_windows_display_adapter_ids` reads the Display class registry key
    `hw_detect.py`'s own `AdapterRAM` fix already trusts for per-adapter
    facts, no COM call and no new failure mode. That question is exactly
    the one worth asking here too, so `_vulkan` now asks it the same way:
    `vulkan-1.dll` presence is still checked FIRST and is still necessary —
    a machine with a real GPU but no Vulkan-capable driver installed has no
    loader at all, and only the DLL check catches that — and on a machine
    that clears it, every adapter being the Microsoft Basic Render Driver
    (`_directml`'s own headless/RDP/VM case: vendor `0x1414`, device `0x8c`)
    now refuses too, for the identical reason `_directml` refuses: a claim
    of GPU acceleration with no hardware behind it. This does not become
    proof a device answers `vkCreateInstance` — it only rules out the one
    case the registry can rule out, a box with no non-software adapter at
    all, which is as far as a registry read can honestly reach; `_vulkan`
    still cannot tell an NVIDIA card from an AMD one, or a Vulkan-capable
    driver from a stale one, the way `_cuda`/`_rocm` can on their own
    platforms. No real device was exercised against this code either way —
    no NVIDIA, AMD, or Windows machine was available while writing it.

    **Not cached, for `_rocm`'s reasons exactly** — a loader package or a
    driver installed while the app is running is a fix that must be seen
    without a restart.

    **Platform half unchanged.** `onnxruntime-directml` links against
    `DirectML.dll` and `d3d12.dll`, both of which ship with Windows itself
    from Windows 10 1903 onwards, and DirectML runs on ANY Direct3D 12
    adapter — a discrete NVIDIA or AMD card, Intel Arc, or the integrated GPU
    every desktop Windows machine has. There is no "no driver installed"
    state to detect and nothing to `dlopen`-check, so `_vulkan`'s loader/ICD
    split has no equivalent here.

    **The adapter half is new, and its old absence was a documented
    trade-off that stopped holding.** This function's earlier revision
    argued no adapter check was needed BECAUSE the row was opt-in from the
    Engines tab and sat below `onnx-embed`, so `auto` never reached it —
    "every answer it could give on a machine that reaches this row is yes"
    was true only because reaching it meant a user had already chosen it
    with eyes open. The GPU-first reorder made this row the embeddings
    default on EVERY Windows x86_64 machine `auto` resolves on, including a
    headless server, an RDP session, or a VM with no GPU passthrough — none
    of which has anything but the Microsoft Basic Render Driver (`vendor
    0x1414`, `device 0x8c`, WARP-backed software rasterization), on which
    `onnxruntime-directml`'s own session creation fails at load. A machine
    whose only adapter is that one is refused here for the same reason
    `_vulkan`'s software-ICD check refuses lavapipe-only Linux: a claim of
    GPU acceleration that the hardware cannot back up.

    **Fails OPEN on anything the registry read cannot settle** — `None`
    (non-Windows test env, a permissions failure, a registry shape this
    function does not recognise) or an empty list (enumerated successfully,
    found nothing) both pass rather than refuse, the same asymmetry `_cuda`'s
    "no driver-version floor" docstring argues for: refusing a machine that
    might well work, on a probe that failed to read it correctly, is a worse
    mistake than the loose check this replaces. Only an EXPLICIT, exclusively
    software adapter list refuses.

    `win_amd64` only, from the distribution's own wheel list (checked against
    `onnxruntime-directml` 1.24.4, which publishes `cp311`-`cp314` for
    `win_amd64` and no other tag) — so a Windows ARM64 machine is refused here
    even though plain `onnxruntime` serves it.

    Not cached, for `_rocm`'s reasons: the platform cannot change under a
    running app, but every other probe in this section declines caching and an
    `lru_cache` on one of them would make test ORDER significant against the

# table's original policy, made deliberately: GPU-backed inference beats
# CPU-backed inference on every capability that has both, and a user who wants
# the CPU build back can still ask for it BY CODE from the Engines tab (D302).
# The cost this reversal accepts, and does not hide: the accelerated wheels
# are much larger downloads with a hardware requirement, and that download now
# happens on a machine that never explicitly asked for it — it asked for
# "auto" and got whichever build the hardware probe says will actually run.
# `code` on each family's original (unaccelerated) row is UNCHANGED, so a
# stored preference naming `diffusers-image` keeps meaning what it meant.
#
# **A code that is REMOVED is a different matter, and `resolve()` is where it is
# handled rather than here** (D416): the three `transformers-text*` codes were
# registered rows until D416 and a synced prefs.json can still name one. Nothing
# in this table pretends they exist — a stale preference is reported as unknown
# and the ordering decides instead, which is the same path a preference written
# by a NEWER build already took. See `resolve()`'s third bullet, and
# `test_a_removed_engine_code_in_prefs_degrades_to_the_ordering`.
#
# **A hardware variant carries its accelerator in BOTH names**, so `label` and
# `short_label` are equal on all three Diffusers rows and both llama.cpp ones
# ("Diffusers (CUDA)", "llama.cpp (CPU)"). The short name is what the Local card
# and `servingLine` print, and three engines whose short names are all
# "Diffusers" would render as one engine on every surface but the picker. The
# qualifier names the BUILD rather than the reader's machine, which is why the
# CPU rows keep it on a Mac that runs them on the GPU — and why naming a row
# after its FORMAT instead does not work: "llama.cpp (GGUF)" beside "llama.cpp
# (Vulkan)" qualified the wrong axis, since both rows read GGUF through the same
# `runners/llama_text.py`. The MLX rows keep a PLATFORM qualifier on the long
# name only — a bracketed qualifier in the SHORT name is therefore the marker
# of a hardware variant, and the Apple-only rows stay visually distinct from
# them.

    # on this GPU tier, 2.4x on CPU, at a third of the download and a third of

    into the reason, and the two must be the SAME string for `ignoredWarning`'s
    `reason.includes(name)` check to find it — a full qualified label
    ("MLX Whisper (Apple Silicon)") would not occur inside a reason that only
    ever names the short one.

    Two cases return None, and the caller (`strandedSelection` on the frontend,
    mirrored here) cannot always tell them apart from the payload alone: `auto`
    is never stranded, and a WITHDRAWN code (`by_code` finds nothing — D416's
    `transformers-text*`) has no runner to ask a label of. Both leave the
    Engines tab to fall back to the bare stored code, which is the whole reason
    that fallback exists.
