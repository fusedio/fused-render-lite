"""The live preview: the picture WHILE it is being denoised (SPEC §40).

`fused.ai.image` writes its PNG once, at the end. A FLUX render is minutes long
and for all of them the only thing a page can show is a step counter — a
progress bar for a process whose entire output is visual. This module is the
fix: a `<out without ext>.preview.png` beside the image the request already
named, ~32x32 and ~3KB, **overwritten every step**, which a page points an
`<img>` at. Blurring and upscaling it is the page's business, not this API's.

**Always on, no flag.** Measured at 68ms per step for the projection plus the
PNG at 512²/16 steps — 1.25% of the render — and dominated by the device->CPU
sync and the PNG encode rather than by the matmul, so it stays roughly flat as
the resolution grows. A feature that costs one percent does not need an opt-in;
an opt-in would only guarantee that most pages never get it.

**This module is the whole of the feature and it sits at the runners ROOT**,
beside `worker_base.py`, `formats.py`, `diarize.py` and `partial.py`, for the
reason AI-10c states: two engines serve one capability and a page must not be
able to tell which one ran. The path rule, the arithmetic, the write and the
lifecycle exist once, and `tests/test_ai_image_preview.py` pins that
structurally — a second `preview.py` under either image runner would fail no
behavioural test, because both copies would pass their own.

**Stdlib only at import time, and no import of `fused_render_lite`.** The same
constraint `formats.py`, `diarize.py` and `partial.py` document, for the same
two reasons: each runner runs on its own interpreter with the app's package off
its path, and the SERVER imports this file too — to derive the path it
advertises to the page — so reading it must not need either runner venv. numpy
and Pillow are both present in both image venvs (torch/mlx pull the first,
`pillow`/`mflux` the second) and both are used, inside the functions that need
them.

## Why a model's `estimate` strategy matters

A denoising loop's raw latent is not always the picture. FLUX.2 klein is
step-wise **distilled**, and its sigma schedule is nothing like a normal
flow-matching one. A real 16-step render walked

    1.0, 0.991, 0.98, 0.968, 0.955, 0.939, 0.921, 0.9, 0.875, 0.845,
    0.808, 0.761, 0.7, 0.617, 0.5, 0.318, 0.0

— still at sigma 0.5 with two steps to go. What the denoising callback holds is
therefore mostly noise for almost the whole render, and projecting it gives a
preview that is grey static until the last frame, which is the frame nobody
needed. What IS legible from step 2 of 16, and converges visibly to the finished
image, is the model's own current guess: recover the velocity from two
consecutive latents and extrapolate it to sigma 0.

    v      = (x_next - x_prev) / (s_next - s_prev)
    x1_hat = x_next - s_next * v

klein's entry in `PROJECTIONS` therefore carries `"estimate": "extrapolate"`.
Step 1 has no predecessor and so gets no preview under this strategy — that is
correct rather than a gap to paper over, because a first frame projected from
the raw latent is exactly the static extrapolation exists to avoid.

An ordinary, non-distilled sigma schedule does not have that problem: its raw
latent is legible from early on, which is how every other UI previews a normal
diffusion model. An entry for a model like that carries `"estimate": "raw"`,
and the sink projects the latent it is handed directly, with no predecessor
needed — so step 1 DOES get a frame, unlike an extrapolating entry's gap.

## Why the projection is a fitted constant, and why it is per-model

Each entry's `factors`/`bias` pair is a fitted affine map from that model's own
packed latent-token space to sRGB, and nothing about the map generalises across
latent spaces: FLUX.1's published 16-channel latent-RGB factors do not apply to
klein, and klein's 128-wide matrix does not apply to a 4-channel VAE either. The
channel width a `project()` call uses comes from the entry's own `factors`, not
from a module constant, which is what lets one code path serve every fitted
model regardless of its channel count.

klein's VAE is `AutoencoderKLFlux2`: 32 latent channels, a 2x2 patchify (so 128
channels per token), 8x spatial (so `"stride": 16`), and a normalisation that is
a **BatchNorm** (`vae.bn.running_mean` / `running_var` +
`vae.config.batch_norm_eps`) rather than the usual `scaling_factor`/
`shift_factor` pair. A denoising callback holds `(1, H*W, 128)` row-major
packed tokens with a grid side of `image side / 16`.

klein's map was fitted, once, by `fit_factors.py`: encode the three sample jpgs
that ship in the FLUX.2 repo through the torch VAE, patchify and BN-normalise to
land in **exactly the space the callback sees**, box-downsample each source
image 16x to one pixel per token, and least-squares a 128->3 affine map between
them. R² = 0.911 / 0.912 / 0.891 per channel, residual RMS 0.083 in [0,1]. The
numbers are written down here rather than derived at runtime because deriving
them needs the VAE weights, which is the one thing a preview must not wait for.

Stable Diffusion 1.5's map was fitted the same way, and the method is the part
worth copying for a third model: five 512² images through the model's own
`AutoencoderKL`, scaled by the config's `scaling_factor` (0.18215) so the fit
lands in the space the callback holds, box-downsampled 8x to one pixel per
token, least-squares over the 20,480 tokens that gives. R² = 0.885 / 0.923 /
0.876, residual RMS 0.097. Four channels rather than 128, no patchify — hence
`"stride": 8` — and an ordinary schedule, hence `"estimate": "raw"`.

**One matrix serves both engines, per entry.** `bn.running_mean` and
`bn.running_var` are bit-identical (max|diff| = 0.0) between
`black-forest-labs/FLUX.2-klein-4B` and `mlx-community/FLUX.2-Klein-4B-4bit`,
and mflux's `decode_packed_latents` applies the same `packed * bn_std + bn_mean`
with the same unpatchify permutation that diffusers' id-scatter produces for
text2image. That is why the table below is keyed by the VAE's class name and
not by the repo id: the two runners reach the same row from opposite directions
(`type(pipe.vae).__name__` on one side, `formats.MFLUX_VARIANTS[...]["vae"]` on
the other), and a model whose latent space nobody has fitted gets **no preview
at all** — a working no-op sink, so a render without an entry behaves exactly as
it did before this module existed. That is what keeps this additive.

#: * `"factors"` / `"bias"` — the fitted `C -> 3` affine map from packed latent
#:   tokens to sRGB: `rgb = tokens @ factors.T + bias`, then clip to [0, 1].
#:   `factors` is three rows (R, G, B) of `C` weights each, one per latent
#:   channel — `C` is read off `len(factors[0])`, never assumed, so a 4-channel
#:   entry and klein's 128-channel one run through the same `project()`.
#: * `"stride"` — pixels per latent token, per axis, for `token_grid`: the
#:   VAE's spatial downsample times its patchify factor (1 when a VAE is not
#:   patchified).
#: * `"estimate"` — which of the two strategies below `Sink._add` uses to turn
#:   what the callback holds into a frame:
#:     - `"extrapolate"`: recover the velocity between the previous and current
#:       latent and extrapolate it to sigma 0 (see the module docstring for
#:       why a distilled schedule needs this). Step 1 has no predecessor and
#:       gets no frame.
#:     - `"raw"`: project the current latent as it stands. An ordinary,

#:       strategy needs no predecessor and DOES write a frame on step 1.

#: right for a latent space is a measurement somebody took, not something to
#: infer.

#: A model absent from here is not broken — it renders exactly as it did before
#: this module existed, with no preview file and no branch in its denoising loop.

    """A single-frame view of an image being denoised.

    Use it as a context manager around the whole render INCLUDING the final
    save, because the exit is the lifecycle — and here the lifecycle is simpler
    than `partial.Sink`'s in the one way that matters: **every exit discards.**

    A clean exit means the real PNG landed, so the preview is duplicate bytes at
    a thirty-second of the resolution. A cancel means the user pressed ✕ and
    does not want this picture. And an ERROR discards too, which is where this
    diverges from the transcript sink — deliberately, and it is the one
    difference worth stating: a run that died at minute 80 of 90 has 80 minutes
    of words in its partial file and that file is the only salvage there is,
    whereas a render that died at step 12 of 16 has a 32x32 blur of a picture
    that will never exist. Not salvage; just a file in `ai/images/` that no job
    row explains and nothing will ever clean up. That is also why this class
    takes no `cancelled=` argument: with all three exits doing the same thing,
    it never has to tell one exception from another.

        `latents` is a **callable returning** the latents, not the latents, and
        that is the point: reading them off the device is a synchronisation
        that costs most of the measured 68ms, and a sink that is not writing
        must not charge the render for it. Passing a closure instead of an
        array is what lets both denoising loops call this unconditionally —
        the `if preview:` branch `partial.sink`'s no-op exists to avoid.

        `sigma` is the schedule value the run has just arrived AT: after step
        index `i`, diffusers' scheduler has moved from `sigmas[i]` to
        `sigmas[i+1]`, and mflux's `config.scheduler.sigmas` indexes the same
        way off the callback's `t`.

        **NOTHING escapes this method, and that is the whole of it.** It is
        called from inside a denoising callback, which is the one interruption
        point in a `pipe()` / `generate_image()` call that runs for minutes — so
        an exception here does not fail a thumbnail, it unwinds the render and
        destroys work that was going to succeed. The failures are real and are
        not hypothetical: `save` on a full disk, `os.replace` against a Windows
        lock held by the page's own `<img>` reading this very file through
        `/api/fs/raw` (the hazard `discard` already swallows, one line of
        reasoning below), a device that has fallen over inside `latents()`, a
        latent shape nobody predicted. Both runners' `_sigma_after` helpers
        state this invariant; this is where it is actually kept.

        Broad on purpose — a list of expected exception types is a promise
        about a third-party library's failure modes, and getting that list
        wrong costs a render. What a failure DOES cost is the temp file it may
        have left, which is removed here, and eventually the feature: after
        `MAX_FAILURES` in a row the sink turns itself into the same working
        no-op an unfitted model gets, rather than paying a device sync and a
        doomed syscall on every remaining step.
