"""Speech to text on MLX: one resident model, four routes (SPEC §40, AI-10c).

The Apple Silicon half of a capability `faster_whisper/` already serves
everywhere. Same contract, same result dict, same two output files, same job
row — a page cannot tell which of the two transcribed for it, and that is the
point: `fused.ai.transcribe()` is about audio, not about backends. Read
`faster_whisper/worker.py` alongside this; where the two agree, the reason is
written down there and not repeated here.

Four things are genuinely different, and all four follow from `mlx_whisper`
being a library rather than a streaming decoder:

* **This process decodes the audio itself, with `av`.** `mlx_whisper.transcribe`
  accepts a path, and on that path it calls openai-whisper's `load_audio()`,
  which SPAWNS `ffmpeg`. This app bundles rclone, not ffmpeg (see this folder's
  `pyproject.toml`), so that path is closed: `_decode_audio` turns the file into
  16 kHz mono float32 through PyAV's in-process ffmpeg libraries and the
  waveform is what `transcribe()` is given. The library takes an ndarray on the
  same argument, which is what makes this a one-line difference rather than a
  fork.
* **`vad: true` runs a real speech detector**, as it does on the CT2 runner —
  Silero over ONNX Runtime (`vad.py`), on the waveform `av` already produced.
  The silence is dropped, the remaining speech is CONCATENATED into clips of up
  to `vad.BUDGET_S` seconds (one `transcribe()` call each, because the library
  pads every call to a 30-second window — a call per region made `vad: true`
  slower than no VAD at all on the large models), and every timestamp is mapped
  back to original-recording time through `vad.original_start`/`original_end` (a
  time on a join is the start of the next region or the end of the previous one,
  never both). The cut is always at a boundary the detector found in silence,
  never at a fixed offset.
* **`transcribe()` is ONE blocking call, not a generator.** faster-whisper hands
  back a stream and progress falls out of consuming it. Here the whole
  transcript arrives at once, so the per-segment tick that carries progress AND
  the ✕ does not exist. Both are rebuilt from the outside: the call runs on a
  thread and this one ticks (`_call_with_ticks`, the same shape and the same
  reason as the whisper runner's), and the position it reports comes from the
  library's own frame counter (`_watch_progress`).
* **Progress stays SECONDS OF AUDIO** (SPEC AI-10a, and `runtime.js` promises it
  to pages). See `_watch_progress` for how, and for what it costs.
* **The model is not "loaded" by a call of ours.** `mlx_whisper` keeps its model
  in a module-level holder keyed by path, so `load()` primes that holder rather
  than storing a handle here — otherwise the first transcription would load the
  weights a second time, inside the request, having already reported ready.

**A cancel is honoured, and better than the CT2 runner manages.** The ✕ arrives
as the reply to a tick, exactly as it does there — but here the tick thread can
also poke the decode: `_STOP` is checked inside the progress hook, so the
abandoned `transcribe()` raises at the next window instead of running the file
to its end. The orphan machinery below is kept anyway, because "the next window"
is up to 30 seconds of audio away and the phase before it (`av` decoding) has no
hook at all.

def _pin_stream():
    """Put this thread's MLX work on the process's ONE shared stream.

    **MLX streams are per-THREAD from mlx 0.32 on, and this worker is threaded.**
    The weights are primed on the bring-up thread (`worker_base.serve` runs
    `load` on one), each request arrives on a `ThreadingTCPServer` thread, and
    each decode runs on a fresh thread of its own (`_call_with_ticks`). Under
    0.32 a thread that touches MLX gets its own default stream — and an
    UNEVALUATED array is a graph pinned to the stream it was built on, so
    forcing it from another thread does not raise a Python exception. It throws
    `std::runtime_error("There is no Stream(gpu, 1) in current thread")` out of
    `metal::get_command_encoder`, which is an UNCAUGHT C++ exception and aborts
    the process.

    **The exact leak, because "loaded on another thread" alone is not it.** An
    array that has been EVALUATED travels between threads perfectly well —
    measured, in every direction, including from a thread that has since exited.
    `mlx_whisper.load_model` ends on `mx.eval(model.parameters())`, so the
    weights are fine. What it misses is that `nn.Module.valid_parameter_filter`
    **skips keys beginning with an underscore**, and this model derives two
    tensors at construction and stores them under exactly such names:
    `TextEncoder._positional_embedding` (a `sinusoids(...)` graph) and
    `TextDecoder._mask` (a causal mask). `parameters()` does not report them,
    `mx.eval` therefore never forces them, and they reach the decode thread as
    live graphs owned by the loading thread. The first thing `transcribe()` does
    there is `detect_language`, whose encoder pass adds `_positional_embedding`
    — so every MLX Whisper transcription died on its first decode, on every
    model, leaving only a `libc++abi:` line in the worker log and "the
    transcription process did not answer: Remote end closed connection without
    response" on the job row.

    Confirmed by removing only that one difference: pre-evaluating those two
    tensors on the loading thread, with no stream pinning at all, transcribes
    cleanly; without it the same script aborts. Pinning is still the fix worth
    shipping — it holds for whatever the NEXT version of this library leaves
    lazy, where a list of two attribute names would not.

    The invariant this protects, and the one to test any sibling runner against:
    **nothing lazy may survive the loading thread.** `mflux_image/worker.py` used
    to document why it satisfied that already and needed no pin; it does not, and
    now pins too. Read its `load` before trusting a "same shape, but fine"
    argument here — it also records the part this function does NOT cover: the
    default stream is per (thread, DEVICE), so `make(mx.default_device())` below
    pins the GPU only and leaves this thread's CPU default alone.

    `new_thread_unsafe_stream` is mlx's own answer: a stream not owned by the
    thread that made it. "Unsafe" means it must not be driven by two threads AT
    ONCE, which this worker already guarantees — the supervisor serializes
    transcriptions (`_TRANSCRIBE_LOCK`) and an abandoned decode is waited for
    (`_await_orphan`) before the next one starts.

    A no-op on an mlx too old to have the call, which is the right answer:
    streams were process-wide there and there was nothing to pin.

    "Download" that leaves a cache which cannot work offline has not done the
    thing the button said it would. `vad` defaults to true, so a user who
    downloads a model on wifi and transcribes on a train would otherwise find
    the feature quietly degraded at exactly the wrong moment.

    Best-effort, and deliberately so: the detector is an optimisation over a
    transcription that works without it (see `_speech_regions`), so a Hub
    hiccup while fetching 2MB must not fail an 8GB model download that has
    already succeeded.

    **Best-effort stops at the ✕.** `Cancelled` is now something a fetch really
    raises — the tick carries it back (`worker_base.fetch_with_progress`), where
    it used to be latent — and it is the one exception here that is not a Hub
    hiccup. Absorbed, it would print "could not pre-fetch the speech detector:
    Cancelled" and report the download DONE, so a user who pressed stop would

    * **`fltp` planar float**, because that is what Whisper's front end wants

    nothing is known about, so its ticks carry no numbers; here the same
    mechanism carries real seconds-of-audio progress during transcription (see

    the failure `faster_whisper/worker.py` documents as "an hour of decoding
    discarded at 99%", reached by a different route: there the race is a cancel
    on the last SEGMENT, here it is a cancel during the last REPORT.

    **The problem this solves is a PUBLIC one.** SPEC AI-10a and the
    `fused.ai.transcribe` doc comment in `runtime.js` both promise that
    `onProgress` gives `done`/`total` in seconds of audio. faster-whisper
    delivers that for free — its generator yields segments and the loop reports
    each one's end timestamp. `mlx_whisper.transcribe()` is one blocking call
    that returns everything at once, so the honest reading of it is 0% for the
    length of the recording and then 100%. A page written against the documented
    contract would draw a frozen bar for eighteen minutes, which is the failure
    mode this app treats as worse than no bar at all.

    Two ways to keep the promise, and this is the cheaper one:

    * **Chunk the audio here** and call `transcribe()` per chunk. Rejected as a
      way of getting PROGRESS: the library's own window seeking is what makes
      Whisper accurate across a boundary (it re-seeks to the last timestamp
      rather than cutting at a fixed offset, and conditions each window on the
      previous text), so chunking at arbitrary offsets trades transcript
      quality for a progress bar. (The VAD path does cut the audio — but only
      at boundaries the detector found IN SILENCE, where there is no sentence
      to cut through. Different cut, different trade; see `_transcribe_regions`.)
    * **Read the counter the library already keeps.** `transcribe()` runs its
      window loop inside `tqdm.tqdm(total=content_frames, unit="frames")` and
      calls `update()` with each window it finishes. That is exactly the number
      wanted, already in the right unit, measured by the code doing the work.

    So the module's `tqdm` binding is swapped for `_Ticker` for the duration of
    the call and restored afterwards. **This reaches into another package's
    module globals, and that is a real cost** — it is not part of mlx-whisper's
    API and a future version may not have it. Hence the guard: if the attribute
    is not there, the transcription runs exactly as before and the ticks carry
    no numbers instead of wrong ones, which `generate` reports honestly. The
    swap is also why `verbose=False` is passed: the bar is constructed only when
    verbose is False (`disable=verbose is not False`), and with `verbose=None`
    — the library's default — there would be nothing to borrow.

    What it costs in resolution: the counter advances once per decoded window,
    which is up to 30 seconds of audio, where faster-whisper reports every
    segment (a few seconds). Coarser, same unit, same meaning. A recording whose
    windows contain no speech is skipped without an update, so the bar can sit
    still through a long silence and then jump — it is behind, never ahead.

    an empty list is the detector saying there is no speech in this recording,
    while None is this function saying it could not ask.

    **A detector that cannot be fetched degrades to no filtering rather than
    failing the transcription.** The trade is stated rather than assumed: the

    that is the point of the shape: the filtered and unfiltered paths are ONE
    loop, so the timestamp remap, the progress mapping and the cancel behaviour
    cannot drift between them. `vad: false` is not a different code path, it is
    a pack list of length one.

    A recording the detector finds NO speech in also decodes whole. Reporting
    an empty transcript for a file nobody looked at would be the confident
    version of a wrong answer — the detector is tuned for speech, not for
    whispering, singing or a bad microphone, and Whisper's own no-speech
    handling is the better final word.

    `packs` is `_packs_to_decode`'s list: one entry per `transcribe()` call,
    each a list of regions whose speech that call is handed CONCATENATED.

    **`total` and `duration` are the same seconds in two currencies**, and the
    split came from the withdrawn `parakeet_mlx/worker.py` (D406), ported
    rather than reinvented: `total`
    is what the ROW carries and is None for a recording too short to round to a
    tenth of a second, because an indeterminate bar is the honest rendering of
    "no length worth showing"; `duration` is the arithmetic, and is 0.0 there.
    Only the reporting may see the None.

    `progressive` is the partial-transcript sink (`runners/partial.py`), fed
    from the one place in this file where a segment is finished AND already
    remapped into original-recording time — the only point at which a line is
    safe to publish, since a page seeking a player off a clip-relative
    timestamp would land in the wrong minute. Omitted, a no-op stands in.

    **The cut is at a VAD boundary, never at a fixed offset**, and that is what
    makes this loop acceptable where the chunking `_watch_progress` rejects is
    not. Whisper's accuracy across a boundary comes from re-seeking to the last
    timestamp and conditioning each window on the previous text; cutting mid
    sentence throws both away. A VAD boundary is by construction a stretch of
    silence at least `MIN_SILENCE_S` long, which is where a sentence has already
    ended.

    **How MANY of those cuts share a call is a cost question, and the answer is
    "as many as fit"** (`vad.pack_regions`). The library pads every call's mel to
    its full 30-second window, so a call per region billed 30 seconds of encoder
    for a 0.8-second region: `vad: true` cost `large-v3-turbo` 23.30s on a
    216-second recording that decodes whole in 8.32s, and 9.31s once packed. The
    silence still never reaches the decoder — the clip is the regions
    concatenated, not one span from the first to the last, which is the
    difference between dropping the silence and merely relabelling it.

    **What is still lost is conditioning ACROSS a CALL.** `condition_on_previous_
    text` operates inside one `transcribe()` call, so the first region of a clip
    starts with no memory of the last region of the one before it — a proper noun
    established early can be spelled differently later. Packing shrinks that loss
    rather than removing it: regions inside one clip now do condition on each
    other (it is one continuous waveform to the decoder), which is a side effect
    of the packing and not its reason. Carrying the previous clip's tail in as
    `initial_prompt` was considered and NOT done: it invites the model to
    continue a sentence that finished before the silence, which is the known way
    to trigger a repetition loop, and it would make each clip's output depend
    on the previous clip's errors. A caller's own `initial_prompt` goes to
    EVERY clip instead, since it is context about the recording as a whole
    (names, jargon) rather than about a position in it.

    **The language is detected once and then pinned.** With `language=None` each
    call would detect independently, so a quiet region could come back as a
    different language and the transcript would change tongue halfway down. The
    first region's answer is used for the rest, which is also faster: detection
    is a decode of its own.

    **Clamped into the segment, never dropped**, which is the opposite of what

    after mapping (the library timing it into the 30-second padding, the same
    place a segment can invert) collapses to an INSTANT at the nearest bound
    rather than vanishing. A zero-length word renders as un-highlightable, which

    a missing word renders as a hole in the sentence.
