"""Text-to-image on diffusers: one resident pipeline, four routes (SPEC §40).

**This module is the whole of the runner and it sits at the runners ROOT**,
beside `worker_base.py`, `formats.py` and `preview.py` — which is the rule
`preview.py` states about itself, applied one level out. THREE folders serve this
one engine — `diffusers_image/`, `diffusers_image_cuda/` and
`diffusers_image_rocm/` — and they differ only in which index their
`pyproject.toml` takes torch from. CUDA and ROCm are the DEFAULT now on a
machine `registry._cuda`/`_rocm` finds usable hardware for (the GPU-first
policy decision, `registry.py`'s block comment above `_RUNNERS`); CPU is what
a user without one gets automatically, or picks deliberately from the
Engines tab to move away from an accelerator. Either way the hardware
selected is a fact about the wheel, never about the code. Each folder's
`worker.py` is a five-line shell around
`torch_image.main()`; a second copy of the pipeline recipes, the GGUF swap or the
preview wiring under any of them would fail no test, because each copy would pass
its own.

The image counterpart of `mlx_text/worker.py`, and the same shape: the HTTP
contract, the download reporting and the state machine are `worker_base`'s, and
what lives here is only what is true of diffusers in particular — which pipeline
class to build, which device to put it on, and how a denoising loop reports
itself.

Two things make this different from the text runner, and both are deliberate:

* **`/generate` answers with ONE JSON object, not a stream.** An image is an
  artefact, not a sequence of tokens; there is nothing to stream until it is
  finished. Its progress is DENOISING STEPS, and those go to the job row the
  caller is already watching (`body["job"]`) — the same download manager that
  shows the weights arriving shows the picture being made.
* **The PNG is written by this process to a path the SERVER chose** (`body["out"]`).
  The server owns where user files go; this process owns the pixels. It never
  invents a location.

**Cancelling works through the job row.** `pipe()` is one opaque C call with no
interruption point, so the only place a stop can be honoured is the per-step
callback diffusers gives us — and the reply to the progress tick we were sending
anyway is how the manager's ✕ reaches a process that cannot look at anything
else. That is why `report_or_cancel` returns the record.

**Quantized single-file transformers.** The one model this runner ships a recipe
for — FLUX.2 klein — is unusable in full precision on the machines this app runs
on: the bf16 transformer is ~8GB and OOMs a 16GB Mac. The recipe swaps in a
~2.6GB Q4_K_M GGUF for that one component and takes the rest of the pipeline
(text encoder, VAE, tokenizer, scheduler) from the normal repo, with the
transformer subfolder deliberately NOT downloaded. Anything without a recipe
loads the ordinary way through `AutoPipelineForText2Image`.

#: The loaded pipeline and the device its generator wants. One per process.
_loaded = {}

#: Repo id -> the quantized single-file transformer to use instead of the one in
#: the repo, and the pipeline class that takes it.
#:
#: A TABLE rather than a heuristic: which quantization of which component is
#: safe for a given model is an editorial judgement (the same one `catalog.py`
#: makes about what to suggest), not something to infer from a file listing. A
#: model absent from here is not unsupported — it loads the ordinary way.
#:
#: **`keep` is an ALLOW-list, and that is the whole design.** It was a deny-list
#: naming `transformer/*.safetensors`, and it saved nothing: the FLUX.2 repo
#: also ships `flux-2-klein-4b.safetensors` at its ROOT — the same 7.75GB of
#: transformer weights again, bundled the way ComfyUI wants them — which no skip
#: pattern matched, `from_pretrained` never opens, and the download therefore
#: fetched. The recipe cost 18.6GB where the model needs 10.8. A deny-list has
#: to predict every extra bundle a repo may carry (and repos gain them without
#: warning); what `from_pretrained` READS is knowable and finite —
#: `model_index.json` plus the component subfolders it names — so that is what
#: is written down.
#:
#: The transformer's CONFIG is kept while its weights are not, and it is the one
#: entry whose absence would be invisible until a machine went offline:
#: `from_single_file(config=<repo>, subfolder="transformer")` reads it to know
#: what it is building, so a recipe that dropped the whole subfolder would leave
#: a cache that still needs the network to load — "Download" reporting success
#: and then failing offline, which is the one promise that button makes.
#:
#: `repo` names the component repo the GGUF comes out of, and the FILENAME is
#: read from `formats.COMPONENT_REPOS` rather than repeated here: that repo also
#: lands in the Hub cache, where the AI Models page has to be able to say what
#: it is, and the page runs in a process that cannot import this venv.
#:
#: **`quantize_4bit` names the components to quantize AT LOAD, and it exists
#: because swapping the transformer only fixed the smaller half of the bill.**
#: The recipe below replaces a 7.75GB bf16 transformer with a 2.43GiB Q4_K_M
#: GGUF and leaves everything else at bf16 — but this repo's TEXT ENCODER is
#: 7.5GB on its own, so after the swap the encoder is ~70% of what the worker
#: holds. Measured on a 15.9GiB RX 9060 XT, 512x512 at 4 steps, prompt and seed
#: fixed:
#:
#:   * bf16 text encoder: `memory_allocated` 10.15GiB, `drm-memory-vram`
#:     10.37GiB, warm render 5.66s / 5.72s, load+`to("cuda")` 3.45s + 3.00s.
#:   * NF4 text encoder: `memory_allocated` 5.10GiB, `drm-memory-vram` 5.35GiB,
#:     warm render 5.76s, load+`to("cuda")` 5.32s + 0.18s.
#:
#: So it HALVES the resident set and is a wash on the clock — 5.76s against
#: 5.72s is inside the run-to-run spread, and the total time to a loaded
#: pipeline actually FALLS (5.50s vs 6.45s), because quantizing costs ~1.9s at
#: load and then there are half as many bytes to copy to the card. Peak during
#: a render drops too (6.65GiB vs a 12.28GiB reserved high-water), which is
#: what `_place()` is measuring against.
#:
#: **NF4 rather than int8, and bitsandbytes rather than a second repo**, for
#: three converging reasons: `bitsandbytes` is already declared in all three
#: manifests and verified on this hardware (see any of their headers), so this
#: costs no new dependency; `tonera/FLUX.2-klein-4B-int8-diffusers` — the model
#: `catalog.py` already recommends — ships its OWN text encoder as bnb NF4
#: (`"load_in_4bit": true, "bnb_4bit_quant_type": "nf4"`), so this is the same
#: format the app already loads rather than a new one; and quantizing at load
#: needs no pre-quantized upload to exist for a given repo, which a table of
#: editorial judgements should not have to wait for.
#:
#: **What this does NOT fix is the download.** The bf16 encoder is still
#: fetched and then quantized in this process, so `keep` is unchanged and the
#: bytes on disk are what they were — see `catalog.py`'s SDNQ entry for the
#: other route, which is smaller to fetch and faster per render but arrives as
#: a whole separate repo.
#:
#: A recipe WITHOUT this key quantizes nothing, which is why it is a list of
#: component names rather than a boolean: the next recipe may want its VAE left
#: alone, or a pipeline with three text encoders may want two of them.

    Today that is exactly one: `sdnq`, which
    `Disty0/FLUX.2-klein-4B-SDNQ-4bit-dynamic` (`catalog.py`) is serialized
    with. diffusers 0.39 knows autoround, bitsandbytes, gguf, modelopt, quanto
    and torchao — every other quantized repo this app loads is one of those,
    and needs nothing here.

    **Imported for a SIDE EFFECT, which is why it looks like an unused
    import.** `sdnq/quantizer.py` ends by mutating
    `diffusers.quantizers.auto.AUTO_QUANTIZER_MAPPING` and its transformers
    twin. Nothing in this file calls an sdnq name, and nothing should: the
    whole integration is that `from_pretrained` can now resolve
    `"quant_method": "sdnq"` out of a component's `config.json` on its own.
    See the runner manifests for the version ceiling that risk buys.

    **Absence is tolerated here, unlike `_load_quantization`'s refusal to
    swallow its own failure.** The asymmetry is real: that function runs only
    when a recipe explicitly asked for quantization, so failing it silently
    would load a model at four times its promised size. This runs on EVERY

    loading. A model that genuinely needs it still fails loudly — diffusers

    nothing is hidden, it is just reported by the layer that actually knows the

    **Double quantization is on.** It quantizes the per-block constants the
    first pass produces, which is the difference between ~0.5 and ~0.4 bits of
    overhead per weight — small in ratio, but this is a 7.5GB component and the
    accuracy cost is the one bitsandbytes documents as negligible. It is also
    what `tonera/FLUX.2-klein-4B-int8-diffusers`'s own text encoder was
    serialized with (`"bnb_4bit_use_double_quant": true`), so the two models
    this runner loads now hold their encoders in the same format.

    **`bnb_4bit_compute_dtype` matches the pipeline's `torch_dtype`, and has
    to.** NF4 is a STORAGE format: every matmul dequantizes to the compute
    dtype first, and a float32 compute dtype against bf16 activations is both
    slower and a dtype mismatch waiting to surface inside an attention block.
    The default is float32, so leaving it out would be choosing the wrong one
    silently.

    **Also correct on Apple Silicon, where `_place()` sends the whole pipe to
    `mps` instead of `cuda`.** This is not a CUDA/ROCm-only trick that happens
    to survive that move: bitsandbytes has shipped a real `mps` backend since
    0.49.0 (`backends/mps/ops.py`), registering `quantize_4bit`,
    `dequantize_4bit`, `gemv_4bit` and `gemm_4bit` behind pure-PyTorch
    fallbacks that need no compiled kernel — only the Hub kernel it also tries
    is macOS-26-and-up. `Params4bit.to()` has no device allow-list; it
    dispatches through whichever of those is registered for the tensor's
    device. The runner manifests' `bitsandbytes>=0.46.1,<1` floor predates a
    macOS wheel — PyPI carries none for bitsandbytes before 0.49.0 — so
    without a committed lockfile a Mac's `uv sync` can only land on 0.49.0 or
    newer, which is exactly the range with the mps backend. The same NF4
    format already ships on `mps` for `tonera/FLUX.2-klein-4B-int8-diffusers`'s
    text encoder, which resolves its `quantization_config` straight out of
    that repo's `config.json` rather than through this function — this recipe
    is the second caller of a device this dependency already had to work on,
    not the first.

    Deliberately NOT wrapped in a try/except. A `_place()` probe that raises
    must degrade to offload because a measurement is advisory; a quantization
    the recipe explicitly asked for is not — if it cannot be applied, the model
    would load at four times the size this recipe promises `_place()` it needs,
    and quietly land in offload on a card that could have held it. Loud is
    correct: `worker_base` turns the raise into the page's load error, with the
    library's own message about what was missing.

    Two cases on CUDA/ROCm — SPEC/D measured on the user's own machine: a
    FLUX.2-klein-4B pipeline via the ROCm GGUF recipe, on a 15.9 GiB RX 9060
    XT with 2.0 GiB already used system-wide. The unconditional `enable_
    model_cpu_offload()` this branch used to call regardless of card size
    left `RssAnon` at 11.7 GiB (the weights, parked in system RAM by
    accelerate) and the worker's own VRAM at 0.59 GiB (HIP context and
    staging only) — the wrong side of the trade on a card that could hold
    the whole model resident:

    1. **All-GPU** — every component's measured size plus `_vram_headroom_
       bytes()` clears `torch.cuda.mem_get_info()`'s free figure: `pipe.to
       ("cuda")`, nothing streamed per render.
    2. **Offload** — it does not fit: today's unconditional `enable_model_cpu_
       offload()`, unchanged.

    A raising `mem_get_info()` or a raising component measurement (an older
    torch, an exotic component type this probe did not anticipate) degrades
    straight to case 2 — the same "a probe must never break loading" reasoning
    `release()`'s per-backend try/except documents just below, applied to the
    measurement instead of the reclaim. That promise covers the MEASUREMENT;
    the all-gpu case's own `pipe.to("cuda")` gets the identical treatment for
    the same reason — `_vram_headroom_bytes()`'s margin is explicitly a
    guess, `free` is sampled once before the move rather than continuously,
    and a competing process (or a component whose real device cost exceeds
    `numel * element_size`) can turn a move that looked safe into a raise. A
    load that would have SUCCEEDED via plain offload must not fail outright
    just because the faster path was tried first, so a raising `.to("cuda")`
    falls back to `enable_model_cpu_offload()` exactly like case 2.

    **A third case — pinning the "hot" set (denoiser + VAE) resident while
    leaving the text encoder to offload's per-call fetch — was built,
    measured, and removed.** A code review surfaced five defects, and
    chasing them down showed the branch could not pay for itself:

    - *Unreachable for the shipping pipeline.* With exactly one non-hot
      `nn.Module`, `hot_bytes + max(other) == total_bytes` exactly, so the
      `elif` was byte-for-byte the `if` above it and could never be the
      first to pass. FLUX.2-klein-4B — the pipeline this feature was built
      for — is that shape (`text_encoder`, `transformer`, `vae`).
    - *It did not save what it claimed.* accelerate's offload is a CHAIN:
      `CpuOffload.pre_forward` offloads `prev_module_hook`'s model
      (`accelerate/hooks.py:744-765`). With the full seq `"text_encoder->
      transformer->vae"`, the transformer's first forward evicted the text
      encoder before denoising even started. Truncating the seq to
      `"text_encoder"` (removing the hot names, as an earlier revision of
      this function did) deleted that link, so the text encoder stayed
      resident for the ENTIRE denoising loop — making hot-gpu's steady-state
      VRAM equal to all-gpu's while claiming to be the cheaper option.
    - *The pin round-tripped every render anyway.* Every FLUX `__call__`
      ends in `maybe_free_model_hooks()`, which re-enters `enable_model_
      cpu_offload` and unconditionally runs `self.to("cpu", silence_dtype_
      warnings=True)` (`diffusers/pipelines/pipeline_utils.py:1244`) before
      re-placing the excluded set — so the "pinned" components made a
      GPU→CPU→GPU trip on every single image, not just at load time.
    - *No fallback on the pin*, unlike the all-gpu move beside it.
    - *`max(others)` undercounts peak* for a pipeline that keeps several
      non-hot components resident at once (a `safety_checker`/`watermarker`
      already in a class's `_exclude_from_cpu_offload`, or a `controlnet`
      absent from the seq) — an error in the OOM direction.

    A survey of what could ever reach the branch found nothing worth keeping
    it for, either. Measured from the HuggingFace API (raw repo totals,
    which OVERCOUNT because these repos carry several precision variants of
    the same weights): FLUX.1-schnell has 2 non-hot components with a 0.25
    GB gap between `hot+max(other)` and `total`; SDXL 2 components with a
    1.24 GB gap; SD3.5-medium 3 components with a 3.27 GB raw gap (~1.65 GB
    at what actually loads in bf16). SD3.5's three text encoders are the
    only structurally good fit for this — and even there, on the 15.9 GiB
    RX 9060 XT this feature was built for (~13.9 GiB free, 3 GiB headroom)
    SD3.5-medium at bf16 needs 19.3 GiB for all-gpu and 17.7 GiB for
    hot-gpu, so it still lands in plain offload; quantized far enough to
    reach hot-gpu, it fits all-gpu outright instead.

    Recorded here so the next person with the same idea finds the
    accelerate-chain reason it is not as easy as it looks, rather than
    reinventing it: pinning is a hook-chain problem, not a "which components
    stay resident" problem, and the seq-truncation fix has to preserve the
    chain through whatever it keeps hot. If a three-text-encoder pipeline
    (SD3.5 and friends) ever joins the catalog, that is when to revisit —
    and the chain semantics above are the thing to get right this time.

    The MPS and CPU branches are untouched: MPS's unified memory makes
    offloading pure overhead there (see below), and CPU has nothing to place.
    MPS generators are unreliable, so the seed is taken on the CPU whatever
    the pipeline runs on; a reproducible seed is worth more than the
    microsecond. The two return values differ on MPS, and collapsing them is
    what hid the device from `/health` for as long as this function only
    answered the seed's question: a FLUX render on a Windows CPU is tens of
    minutes, and nothing on screen said which case the user was in.

    Every case reports which one happened via `set_state(placement=...)`,
    which reaches the WORKER's own `/health` endpoint (`worker_base.snapshot`)
    — but nothing downstream reads it today. `supervisor._health` only lifts
    `state`/`detail`/`resident_bytes`/`os_footprint_bytes`/`device` out of
    that response into the `Worker` it is polling, and `describe()` (what the
    app's own `/health`-adjacent API and the AI Models page actually see)
    forwards none of those extra fields either. So `placement` exists,
    survives one hop, and stops — it is not yet visible outside this
    process. Forwarding it is a small, separate change (a `Worker.placement`
    field plus one more key in `describe()`'s dict); this function sets the
    state on the assumption that whoever wires that up later will find it
    waiting here, not because the wiring exists yet.

    function gated on `getattr(torch, "mps", None)` / `hasattr(mps,

    unconditionally on every platform, and `empty_cache` is a plain Python

    say) can never take the other one down with it the way the bug above did.
    `RuntimeError`/`OSError` is the pair `memory()` already catches for the
