"""Speech to text on faster-whisper: one resident model, four routes (SPEC §40).

The third runner, and the same shape as the other two: the HTTP contract, the
download reporting and the state machine are `worker_base`'s, and what lives
here is only what is true of Whisper in particular.

Three things make it different from both, and all three follow from the input
being a RECORDING rather than a prompt:

* **The input is a path, and this process opens it itself.** The worker runs on
  the same machine as the server, so there is nothing to upload and nothing to
  base64 — `body["path"]` is an absolute path the server already checked exists.
* **Progress is SECONDS OF AUDIO**, not tokens and not steps. That is the unit
  the user is thinking in ("it's got through 12 minutes of the 90"), and
  `info.duration` gives the total before the first segment is decoded.
* **The transcript is written by this process to paths the SERVER chose**
  (`body["out"]`, `body["outText"]`). The server owns where user files go; this
  process owns the words. It never invents a location, which is also why the
  `.txt` sibling is passed rather than derived from the `.json`.

**Cancelling works through the job row**, as it does for images — the reply to
the progress tick we were sending anyway is how the manager's ✕ reaches a
process that is otherwise looking at nothing else. It takes TWO mechanisms here,
because the run has two phases and only the second one looks like one:
`transcribe()` hands back a generator that decodes as it is consumed (so the
per-segment loop is a real interruption point), but before it returns it has
already decoded the whole file and run the VAD over it. That eager phase is
minutes on a long recording, so it is ticked from a thread — see
`_call_with_ticks`, which exists because the first cut left exactly that window
silent and uncancellable.

**Nothing here shells out to ffmpeg.** faster-whisper decodes through PyAV,
whose wheels carry the ffmpeg libraries — see this folder's `pyproject.toml`.
A `subprocess` call to a binary the app does not ship would work on the machine
this was written on and fail on a user's.

    CUDA when there is one, CPU otherwise — CTranslate2 has no Metal backend, so
    an Apple Silicon machine transcribes on its CPU cores and is still several
    times faster than real time.

    **`int8` on CPU is a real quality trade, and a deliberate one.** It is
    roughly twice as fast as float32 and a quarter of the memory, at a small
    cost in word error rate — which for a 90-minute recording is the difference
    between a wait and an afternoon. A caller who wants the accuracy back has
    the larger model as the lever, and that is the better one to reach for.

    **CUDA takes the same trade, not the opposite one — `int8_float16`, not
    plain `float16`.** This runner is not the only thing that can be resident
    on the GPU at once (see `torch_image._place`'s size-aware placement and
    `os_footprint_bytes()`), so a smaller footprint here is VRAM handed back to
    whatever else is loaded, for the same small WER cost CTranslate2's own
    quantization docs attribute to int8 generally. faster-whisper's own
    published benchmark (its README, large-v2 on an RTX 3070 Ti) has `int8` at
    2926MB against `float16`'s 4525MB — about a third less VRAM — while being
    slightly FASTER, not slower (59s vs 1:03). `int8_float16` over bare `int8`
    is what keeps that speed: it quantizes the weights but still computes the
    non-quantized layers in float16, rather than in whatever precision the
    checkpoint was converted at (float32, in practice) — CPUs have no native
    float16 compute to fall back to, which is why `int8` alone is CPU's
    version of the same choice. And it degrades safely on hardware that can't
    do it efficiently: CTranslate2 detects an unsupported combination itself
    and converts the weights to one the device supports, logging that it did,

    ours. Diarization is not a whisper feature and cannot be reached through
    that call, so `diarize: true` needs a waveform this process can pass to
    sherpa-onnx.

    Three ways to get one were available and two are worse:

    * **Decode a second time with `av` directly.** It works — it is what
      `mlx_whisper/worker.py` does — but it would decode a 90-minute recording
      TWICE (once here, once inside faster-whisper) and it would name `av` as
      this folder's own dependency in order to reimplement a function
      faster-whisper already exports.
    * **Give this engine a different diarization** — a cheaper one, or none.
      Refused outright: `diarize: true` must mean the same thing on both
      engines the way `vad: true` does (AI-10c), and "the CT2 runner labels
      worse" is exactly the two-behaviours-one-argument failure the runner
      split is not allowed to produce.
    * **Use faster-whisper's OWN decoder and hand the array back to it.**
      `faster_whisper.audio.decode_audio` is the function `transcribe()` calls
      on a path, it produces exactly this array through PyAV, and `transcribe()`
      accepts an ndarray on the same argument. One decode, one library, no new
      dependency and no second implementation of "what 16 kHz mono means".

    So the array is decoded here and passed to `transcribe()` in place of the
    path — which also makes the diarized and undiarized paths differ by an
    argument rather than by a pipeline. **Only when diarizing**: an ordinary
    transcription still hands over the path, so nothing about the common case
    changes shape.

    Ticked, because it is not free: this is the same minutes-long decode of a
