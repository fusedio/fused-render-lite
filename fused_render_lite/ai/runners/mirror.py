"""Our own download path for the suggested models (SPEC AI-5l).

A suggested model is one WE chose to put in front of the user, so the bytes can
come from a distribution we run instead of from huggingface.co. This module is
the whole client half of that: it answers "what does the mirror hold for this
repo, and at which URLs", and nothing else. The bytes themselves are fetched by
`worker_base._segmented_fetch`, which already knows how to range-fetch a file
into hf's cache layout, and what lands on disk is byte-for-byte the cache
directory hf itself would have produced — which is why the loaders, the Local
tab's inventory, disk usage and deletion all keep working untouched.

**Two objects, not a protocol.** A manifest per repo, mutable and short-TTL, and
one immutable blob per distinct etag under the commit:

    <base>/models/<org>/<name>/manifest.json
    <base>/models/<org>/<name>/<commit>/<etag>

**Plus a third shape for ONE named file, which is not a relaxed manifest but a
different claim** (AI-5m):

    <base>/models/<org>/<name>/files/<filename>/manifest.json

`llama_text.download` fetches a single GGUF out of a repo that publishes dozens
of quantizations — `unsloth/Qwen3.5-9B-GGUF` is 147.81GB whole for a 2.6GB
file — and the manifest above cannot serve that, because it has to ASSERT it
lists the whole repo at the commit (`complete: true`, see `validate_manifest`) and
earning that assertion would mean mirroring all of it. So there is a second
reader, `file_manifest`, with its own document and its own claim: exactly one
named file, and no completeness claim at all. What makes dropping the claim safe
rather than convenient is what the CALLER does next — `worker_base.download_file`
writes no AI-5k fetch record and never has, so nothing on this path can record a
partial answer as whole, which is the only harm the assertion exists to prevent.
The blobs stay in the per-repo blob space above, so a repo mirrored both ways
stores one copy of each blob.

That is deliberately NOT `HF_ENDPOINT`, which is a protocol switch: the mirror
would then have to answer `/api/models/…`, produce `x-linked-etag`,
`x-linked-size` and `x-repo-commit` on a resolve, and hold up its end of Xet's
`xet-read-token`. Two objects on any static host with `Range` has none of that
surface. The manifest request is also the one signal that a download STARTED,
and it is made exactly once per attempt before a single byte moves.

**Two environment variables, and the second one is a privacy rule.**
`FUSED_MODEL_MIRROR` is the base URL, and it is **on by default** — unset now
means `DEFAULT_BASE` (`https://render.fused.io/mirror`), not "no mirror". The
explicit opt-out is setting it to `""` (or to anything that is not a valid
`http(s)://host` URL — `"off"`, `"0"`, `"none"` all land there too, for free,
because `_valid_base` already refuses them; there is no separate spelling to
maintain). `os.environ.get` is what makes the distinction possible at all:
unset (`None`) reads as "use the default", set-to-empty reads as "no mirror",
and `_env` below must never collapse those two into one. `FUSED_MODEL_MIRROR_OK`
carries the ONE repo id this process is permitted to name to the mirror, set by
`supervisor._child_env` only when `catalog.all_suggested_ids()` contains it. The
worker cannot make that decision itself: `catalog` is unreachable from a runner's
interpreter, which imports this file as a bare module with no `fused_render_lite`
package on `sys.path`. But more to the point it MUST not — probing the mirror for
an arbitrary repo id would tell us which models a user downloads, and the whole
point of gating it to the curated list is that we never learn that. **A default
base does not widen that rule**: `allowed()` still requires both a base URL AND
`FUSED_MODEL_MIRROR_OK == model_id`, so a model outside the curated list still
produces no manifest request regardless of what the base defaults to.

**Stdlib only**, like `worker_base`, and for the same reason: this file is
imported by every runner's interpreter, so anything imported here becomes a
dependency of every backend forever.

**Validation is a trust boundary.** Everything below comes off a CDN, and the
failure that matters is not a 500 — it is a manifest that is plausible and wrong.
A size that lies puts a short blob under a real etag; a name that climbs out of
the snapshot writes a file wherever it likes; an etag with a slash in it does the
same inside `blobs/`. So every field is checked, and a rejection reads as NO
MIRROR rather than as an error: the caller's contract is that a mirror which is
down, misconfigured or serving junk costs a slower download and never a failed
one.
