"""Embeddings on ONNX Runtime: one resident encoder, one or two towers (SPEC §40).

**This module is the whole of the runner and it sits at the runners ROOT**,
beside `worker_base.py`, `embed_common.py` and `torch_image.py` — the rule
`preview.py` states about itself, applied to embeddings. FOUR folders serve this
engine — `onnx_embed/`, `onnx_embed_directml/`, `onnx_embed_cuda/` and
`onnx_embed_rocm/` — and they differ only in which `onnxruntime` distribution
their `pyproject.toml` installs. Each folder's `worker.py` is a five-line shell
around `onnx_embed.main()`, the same shape `diffusers_image_cuda/worker.py`
documents at length for the image family; a second copy of the padding rule, the
output-name assertion or the provider order under any of them would fail no
test, because each copy would pass its own.

The HTTP contract, the download reporting and the state machine are
`worker_base`'s; what lives here is only what is true of an embedding export
read through an `InferenceSession` in particular.

**TWO SHAPES OF CHECKPOINT, one runner.** A DUAL ENCODER (`siglip`, `clip`) has
a text tower and a vision tower that project into one space, so it opens two
sessions and answers both `texts` and `paths`. A PROSE ENCODER (`bert`,
`xlm-roberta`, `nomic_bert`, `modernbert`) has one tower, opens one session, and
refuses `paths` by name — a text encoder handed pixel values raises somewhere
inside the graph about a tensor rank, which tells a page author nothing, and one
that happened to accept them would embed noise and return a plausible vector.
The fork is decided ONCE, in `load()`, off `formats.embed_model_type` over the
cached `config.json`; nothing below re-derives it.

The prose half is what makes this capability useful for more than captions:
SigLIP's text tower truncates at 64 tokens, so no chunk size turns it into a
paragraph encoder, while a prose encoder takes 512 to 8192 and makes RAG,
document search and clustering possible at all.

**Why this replaced a working torch runner.** A dual encoder is one forward
pass over a short sequence or one image — the compute was never the problem. The
WHEEL was: the withdrawn `transformers_embed*` folders installed torch plus
transformers, 0.2 GB on the CPU index and up to 5.9 GB on an accelerated one,
for a model whose own weights are 1.5 GB. `onnxruntime` is 14-202 MB depending
on the provider and reads the same checkpoint re-exported. Same vectors — there
is a real-weights parity gate, `tests/test_ai_onnx_embed_real_weights.py`,
asserting >=0.999 cosine on both towers, and it is what licensed the removal —
for a fraction of the environment.

**`allow_patterns` is correctness here, not an optimization.** These exports
ship every quantization side by side — `onnx-community/siglip2-base-patch16-384
-ONNX` is 33 files and 11.42 GB in total, the so400m export 29.5 GB — so the
bare `download_snapshot(model_id)` call every other runner here makes would
fetch seven redundant copies of both towers. `download()` below pins the fp32 set, and
`test_ai_onnx_embed_real_weights.py` asserts the fetched byte total against
`catalog.py`'s own figure so a widened pattern list cannot quietly reintroduce
the full pull. **fp32, not fp16 or int8**: the parity gate is what licenses this
engine replacing the torch one, and a precision change would void it.

**Reading the wrong output tensor is this file's headline risk**, and it is not
hypothetical — #813 shipped a runner that reached for the wrong field of a
transformers 5 output, returning a plausible, wrong-shaped vector rather than
raising. An `InferenceSession` makes the same mistake easy: `run(None, feed)`
returns outputs in graph order, and indexing that list reads whatever happens to
be first. So every read here goes through `_output_index`, which asserts the
output NAME and raises naming the model and what the graph actually publishes.
The fakes in `tests/test_ai_onnx_embed_worker.py` carry outputs of deliberately
different ranks for the same reason.

**No `memory()`, unlike `mlx_embed/worker.py`.** That runner supplies one
because MLX keeps memory-mapped, lazy arrays RSS reports as the interpreter
rather than as the model. onnxruntime
publishes no equivalent query, and a CPU session's weights are ordinary process
memory that `worker_base`'s default RSS probe already measures — so `serve()` is
called without `memory=` rather than with a function that can only ever answer
`None`. The accelerated folders' GPU pools are therefore under-reported, which
is a known gap and better than an invented number.

`embed_common.py` (this same directory) is where the request validation and the
unit-normalization live, shared with `mlx_embed/worker.py` because these two
engines produce vectors in the SAME SPACE and must refuse and shape a request
identically.

    there is nothing telling it which positions are padding: pad tokens are real
    input, they reach the encoder, and a wrong pad id moves every text vector.

    First, `pad_token` is commonly serialized as an `AddedToken` OBJECT —
    `{"content": "<pad>", "lstrip": false, ...}` — which is what
    `tokenizer_config.json` holds whenever the token was added rather than baked
    into the vocabulary. `isinstance(pad_token, str)` is False for that, so the

    `<pad>` that is a different token with a different embedding row.

    Second, `token_to_id` returns None for a token that is not in the vocabulary
    at all, and `pad_id or 0` turned that into id 0 — which is a real token on
    every vocabulary (`<s>` on RoBERTa, `[PAD]` on BERT only by luck). Padding a
    64-position SigLIP2 sequence with sixty `<s>` tokens produces a confident
    unit vector describing something the model never saw. `or` also swallows a
    LEGITIMATE id of 0, mapping it to itself by accident rather than by
    agreement.

    So: read both serializations, and if the resulting token is not in the

    either truncate one or ask the other for positions its graph has no weights
    for.

    **The MINIMUM of what the config and the tokenizer say, not the first of
    them, and the reason is RoBERTa.** On RoBERTa and XLM-R
    `max_position_embeddings` is the usable length PLUS TWO — the offset that
    leaves room for `padding_idx` — so `intfloat/multilingual-e5-large`-shaped
    repos declare 514 while their `tokenizer_config` correctly says 512.
    Preferring the config there truncates at 514, walks position ids past the
    embedding table, and fails deep inside the graph with a raw onnxruntime
    gather error that names nothing the user can act on. Taking the min of the
    two sources gets 512 without this function having to know which
    architectures carry the offset — the tokenizer is the artefact that was
    saved for USE, so where the two disagree it is the safer of the two to
    believe.

    Erring SHORT is the whole point: a sequence shorter than the graph allows
    costs a little context on very long inputs, which is also exactly what
    `sentence-transformers` itself does when a repo ships `max_seq_length: 512`
    beside an 8192-position config. A sequence LONGER than the graph allows is
    not a degradation, it is a crash.

    **A declared value always wins; `_ARCH_TEXT_LENGTH` is consulted only when
    the config and the tokenizer are both silent, and it is the last stop
    BEFORE `_DEFAULT_TEXT_LENGTH`, never ahead of it.** Every curated SigLIP2
    dual row is exactly that silent case — see `_ARCH_TEXT_LENGTH`'s own
    comment for why 64 is not a guess there.

    **And on a DUAL encoder, running out of both sources — declared AND
    architectural — is not a case this function may paper over with
    `_DEFAULT_TEXT_LENGTH`.** `_tokenizer` pads a dual encoder's text tower to
    exactly the length this function returns (`_TEXT_PADDING`), and SigLIP's
    text graph takes no `attention_mask` — every padded position is a real
    gather against the checkpoint's position-embedding table. `512` is a
    plausible-looking number that is simply wrong for a 64-position table, and
    wrong there is not a worse vector, it is a gather off the end of the
    table — the exact failure this function exists to prevent, so a dual
    encoder this silent is refused by name instead of quietly padded to a
    number that happens to fit prose encoders.
