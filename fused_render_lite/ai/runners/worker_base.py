"""The worker side of the contract, written once (SPEC AI-3, AI-9).

Every runner is a folder with a `pyproject.toml` and a `worker.py`, started by
`fused_render_lite.ai.supervisor` on the interpreter built from that declaration.
What a worker DOES differs completely — mlx_text loads a language model and
streams tokens, diffusers_image loads a pipeline and writes a PNG — but what it
IS does not: four routes, a token in a header, a port the child publishes, a
state machine the supervisor polls, and progress posted to the download manager.

That invariant half lives here. A concrete worker supplies three functions and
calls `serve()`:

    download(model_id)          fetch what is missing; return where it landed
    load(model_id, fetched)     put it in memory; raise to fail
    generate(body[, write])     one request; NDJSON via `write` or a dict back

and gets `/health`, `/cancel`, `/quit`, `/generate`, `--download-only`, the port
handshake, the auth check, the error framing and the reporting for free.

**Why a shared module rather than two standalone files.** The obvious reading of
"a runner is a folder" is that each folder is self-contained, and the first cut
was exactly that: mlx_text/worker.py carried all of this inline. Copying it for
the image runner would have put the SUPERVISOR'S contract — the auth header's
name, the status file's shape, the state vocabulary it polls for, the way
download bytes are measured — in two places, and every bug in this feature so
far has been two places encoding one rule and drifting apart. The contract
belongs beside the thing that defines it, once.

This module is **stdlib only**, deliberately, for two reasons. It is imported by
every runner's interpreter, so anything imported here becomes a dependency of
every backend forever. And it means the contract is IMPORTABLE BY THE TESTS,
which is the only way any of it gets tested at all: neither concrete worker can
run on CI (one needs Metal, the other several GB of torch), but this can, with
stub callables standing in for the model.

    every request a BRAND NEW thread that exits the moment the response
    finishes. MLX keeps compiled-graph state in a C++ `thread_local` (an
    `mlx::core::detail::CompileCache`); tearing one down runs its destructor
    from `pthread`'s own thread-exit cleanup, well outside anything Python's
    `try`/`except` can reach, and a checkpoint whose generation step is
    `mx.compile`d (mlx-vlm's is) populates that cache on its very first call.
    Reproduced directly, no HTTP involved: two back-to-back `stream_generate`
    calls on the SAME thread never fail, but the same two calls issued from
    TWO DIFFERENT threads in a row crash the process on the second one, deep in

    exits when the response ends, and request 2's thread B is the crash.

    A plain function call, not a generator: streaming (`_stream`) already
    passes its own `write` callback in as an argument, so the callable handed

    **`total_bytes` is the repo/file's FULL size in scope — a RESUME must be
    judged against what remains, not the whole thing again** (code review
    finding 2). Without this, a 30GB model interrupted at 28GB and retried
    with 5GB free was refused ("needs 30.0 GB, only 5.0 GB is free") even
    though only 2GB remained to fetch — defeating the entire `.part`/sidecar
    resume machinery this module otherwise goes to considerable lengths to
    provide. `bytes_on_disk(folder)` is the SAME figure the progress bar
    already trusts for "how much of this repo is durably on disk right
    now" — complete blobs plus a `.fusedpart`'s ALLOCATED-BLOCKS progress,
    not its sparse `ftruncate`d length — so subtracting it here reuses one
    notion of "already have" rather than inventing a second that could
    drift from what the bar reports. `folder` may legitimately hold MORE
    than what is in this fetch's own `allow_patterns` scope (an older
    revision's blobs, a differently-scoped prior fetch); that makes the
    subtraction a slight OVERESTIMATE of what has been durably written for
    THIS scope, which is the safe direction for a precheck to be
    imprecise in — the same "the bar can proceed on a guess" tolerance this
    module's listing-failure fallback already accepts, and refusing a
    resume that would actually have fit is a real regression while letting
    one through that comes up a little short during the fetch is not: the
    fetch itself still fails loudly if it genuinely runs out.

    `total_bytes=None` (a listing failure already degraded the progress bar
    to a guess, or a caller that never learned a total at all) is silently
    skipped — checking against an unknown total would mean either refusing
    every such download outright or checking against a size that IS a guess,
    and the existing `_fallback` degradation for a failed listing already
    treats "no total" as "proceed anyway, the bar just cannot be precise".
    This function makes the identical call for the SAME reason: an unknown
    figure is not evidence of a shortfall. A `remaining` of zero or less (a
    complete or over-complete repo, the fast path above should normally have
    already returned before this is ever called) is likewise skipped —
    nothing left to check space for.

    Checked against the NEAREST EXISTING ancestor of `folder`, because the
    folder itself is usually the thing this download is ABOUT to create —
    `os.statvfs` (what `shutil.disk_usage` calls) needs a path that already
    exists, and a repo's cache folder is created lazily by the first byte
    written into it.

    `shutil.disk_usage` itself failing (an unmounted volume, a path
    `statvfs` cannot reach) degrades to "proceed" rather than blocking a
    download over a filesystem question this function cannot actually

#: A runner's own memory measurement, when it has one better than RSS. Set by
#: `serve()`. MLX is the reason it exists: its weights are memory-mapped and its
#: arrays are lazy, so RSS right after a load reports the interpreter and not
#: the model — 379 MB for a 6GB model, which is what sent us looking.
_measure = None

#: A runner's own PEAK-memory probe, when it has one — SPEC AI-8c, D497. A
#: second, OPTIONAL hook beside `_measure`, for a different question:
#: `_measure`/`resident_bytes()` answer "what is this costing RIGHT NOW",
#: which `supervisor.refresh_memory` only samples when `/health` happens to be
#: read. `fit` (AI-16) needs the HIGH-WATER MARK of a whole load-and-generate
#: pass instead — a staged pipeline like `ltx-video` frees stages between
#: renders (`low_memory=True`), so its peak is whichever stage happened to be
#: resident at the moment someone looked, which bounds nothing. Set by
#: `serve(peak_memory=...)`.
_measure_peak = None

#: The RSS high-water mark this worker has observed, kept HERE rather than by
#: the supervisor — SPEC AI-8c. `resident_bytes()` already runs on every
#: `/health` and at load; remembering the running `max()` of what it measured
#: turns a sparse sample into a monotone bound at the cost of one module-level
#: integer. Still weaker than a runner's own allocator peak (it only sees the
#: moments `/health` was actually polled), which is exactly why a runner that
#: HAS a true peak probe is asked to supply one instead — see `peak_resident_
#: bytes` for the precedence between the two, and AI-16's `basis` for how that
#: difference is carried outward to a reader.
_rss_peak = None

#: A runner's own "give it back to the OS" hook, when it has one. Set by
#: `serve(release=...)` — the third optional hook beside `_measure`/`_measure_
#: peak` above. Never called directly from a request: `_arm_release_timer`
#: starts a `_RELEASE_IDLE_S` clock after every execution, and `_fire_release`
#: is what actually calls this, once that clock runs out with nothing new
#: having started.
#:
#: Why this exists: a live FLUX.2-Klein-4B-4bit render through `mflux-image`
#: needed ~24.12 GB at its peak (`mx.get_peak_memory()`, the `_measure_peak`
#: probe) but settles at 1.7 GB RSS once it is done — and yet the status bar
#: kept showing "1.7 GB now (21 GB held)" (`os_footprint_bytes()`, D597) long
#: after the render finished. MLX frees those buffers back to its OWN pool,
#: never to the OS, and only reclaims the pool once it exceeds `mx.set_cache_
#: limit`'s default — 1.5x the recommended working set, ~38.7 GB on the 34.4
#: GB machine this was measured on, i.e. ABOVE physical RAM, so that condition
#: can never fire on its own. `mx.clear_cache()` is the other side of that:
#: hand the idle pool back once nothing has asked for it in a while.
#:
#: Why an IDLE TIMER rather than an unconditional call in `_single`/`_stream`'s
#: `finally` (the first cut of this feature): a 24 GB working set is not free
#: to re-fault, and clearing right after every execution makes a burst of five
#: renders pay that cost five times over. Waiting `_RELEASE_IDLE_S` after the
#: LAST execution keeps a burst at full allocator speed and still releases the
#: moment the user actually walks away — see `_arm_release_timer` and
#: `_fire_release` for the mechanism, which lives entirely in this process
#: (no supervisor RPC, no new route: the worker already knows when its own
#: last execution ended).
#:
#: Wired into all five MLX runners (`mflux_image`, `ltx_video`, `mlx_text`,
#: `mlx_embed`, `mlx_whisper`) and the shared `torch_image` runner (MPS/CUDA).
#: An idle timer changes the earlier per-call exclusion's arithmetic: it does
#: not fire mid-loop, so a bulk run of embeds or a token stream is never
#: interrupted by it, and the machine this was measured on can hold a speech
#: model (whisper-large-v3, 3.66 GB measured) and a text model resident in
#: SEPARATE PROCESSES at once — the supervisor keeps one worker per
#: capability — each with its own idle pool, so the small-model case stacks
#: rather than disappearing into rounding.
#:
#: Still nothing to wire for `llamacpp_text`/`llamacpp_text*` (a fixed KV
#: context allocated up front, weights mmap'd — there is no reclaimable
#: cache), `faster_whisper` (its CTranslate2 backend exposes no cache-release
#: API), or `onnx_embed`/its cuda/directml/rocm shells (the arena is
#: session-scoped `SessionOptions` config decided at session creation, not
#: something a per-idle clear can touch).
#:
#: This only RECLAIMS memory after a run finishes — it must never be reached
#: for by anything trying to lower the PEAK a render needs (tiled decode,
#: `mx.eval()` boundaries, `set_cache_limit`/`set_memory_limit`): those are
#: separate, unapproved changes to what an execution costs, not to what it
#: leaves behind.
_release = None

#: A runner's own LIVE footprint probe, when it has one — the FOURTH optional
#: hook beside `_measure`/`_measure_peak`/`_release` above, set by
#: `serve(footprint=...)`. Answers a question none of the platform-level
#: readings inside `os_footprint_bytes()` can: how much of a DISCRETE GPU's
#: own memory this worker is holding.
#:
#: Why the gap exists: on Linux `resident_bytes()`'s RSS and `os_footprint_
#: bytes()`'s `psutil` fallback both walk the process's own address space,
#: and a CUDA/ROCm allocation lives in the driver, not there — so a
#: `diffusers_image_rocm` worker holding a FLUX.2-klein-4B pipeline pinned to
#: VRAM (`torch_image._place`'s "all-gpu" case) reported 0.59 GiB
#: of actual VRAM use as if it were memory the reaper had already reclaimed,
#: while `RssAnon` separately showed 11.7 GiB of weights parked in system RAM
#: by `enable_model_cpu_offload()` — both real, neither visible to a probe
#: that only reads `/proc/<pid>/status`. macOS never had this hole: `phys_
#: footprint` already counts the Metal pool a torch-on-MPS or MLX worker uses,
#: which is why this hook is wired ONLY for CUDA in `torch_image.main()` — an
#: MPS figure added on top of `phys_footprint` would double-count the same
#: bytes the platform reading already found.
#:
#: `torch_image.main()` supplies `torch.cuda.memory_reserved()`, not `_
#: allocated()` — see that call site for why reserved is the number that
#: actually moves when `release()`'s `empty_cache()` fires.

def resident_bytes():
    """What this model is costing in memory, or None.

    RSS by default. **THE OLD JUSTIFICATION HERE WAS WRONG AND IS WORTH STATING
    PLAINLY** (D597): it said "on Apple Silicon the GPU pool IS system memory,
    so it is the honest single number and there is no separate VRAM figure to
    reconcile it with". The premise is true — unified memory — but the
    conclusion does not follow, because the pool is not in RSS. Measured on a
    live MLX FLUX worker: 172 MB of RSS against 23 GB of dirty
    `IOAccelerator (graphics)` regions, which are charged to the task's
    `phys_footprint` and never appear in `resident_size`. So RSS is a FLOOR
    here, not an honest total, and `os_footprint_bytes()` below is what answers
    "what is this process actually holding" — as a LOWER BOUND, since neither
    counter it can read is a superset of the other (see its own docstring).
    This function's RETURN VALUE is deliberately unchanged all the same: it
    feeds `peak_resident_bytes` -> `footprints.py` -> `fit.py`'s "measured"
    rung, so redefining it would silently re-verdict every model the user has
    ever run (easy -> tight, tight -> no). Whether a "measured" footprint
    should include the allocator pool is a real question and not this change's
    to answer.
    A runner that can do better supplies `memory=` to `serve()`, and the
    LARGER of the two wins — both are real measurements and neither is a
    superset (RSS includes the interpreter and framework; a framework allocator
    includes buffers that may not be faulted into RSS yet), so the cost is at
    least the larger.

    psutil comes with every runner's environment; if it is somehow absent the
    answer is whatever the runner could measure, or None rather than a guess.

    **Also updates `_rss_peak`**, as a side effect of the one RSS reading this
    function already takes — see `peak_resident_bytes`. Every call site here
    already runs on every `/health` and at load, so no new sampling point is
    needed to turn this into a high-water mark; it would just be a second read
    of the same number.

    **`max(phys_footprint, resident_size)`, NOT `phys_footprint` alone** — code
    review 2026-08-28, finding 3, which corrected a claim this docstring and
    `ModelsDock.tsx`'s `MemoryCell` both used to make: that RSS is a strict
    subset of the footprint. It is not. `phys_footprint` deliberately EXCLUDES
    clean file-backed pages, and those are counted in `resident_size`. Measured
    here, in a plain interpreter with no framework loaded: `resident_size`
    19.2 MB against `phys_footprint` 9.3 MB. So for any runner that maps its
    weights read-only — GGUF/llama.cpp, torch with `mmap=True` — the footprint
    is the SMALLER of the two by roughly the size of the model file, and
    reporting it alone rendered a row as `8.2 GB now (1.1 GB held)`: a visible
    contradiction, with the status bar's colour band painted off the smaller
    number while the machine held the larger.

    NEITHER COUNTER IS THE TOTAL, which is why `max` rather than a choice
    between them: RSS misses the Metal pool (measured on a live MLX FLUX
    worker: 172 MB of RSS against 24 GB of `phys_footprint`, 23 GB of it dirty
    `IOAccelerator` regions), and the footprint misses clean file pages. Their
    max is a strictly better lower bound than either, and it restores the one
    invariant the UI pair depends on — "held" can never read as less than
    "now". A true total would need to add the disjoint parts, which needs a
    region-by-region walk this probe deliberately does not do; hence "lower
    bound" in the first line rather than "what it holds".

    STILL THE NUMBER ACTIVITY MONITOR SHOWS in the case that motivated it: on
    an MLX worker `phys_footprint` dominates by three orders of magnitude, so
    the max IS the footprint and a user watching their system monitor sees the
    figure this reports. The correction only ever raises the answer, and only
    where RSS is the bigger of the two.

    NOT `resident_bytes()`, and not a redefinition of it — see that function's
    own docstring for why its value is frozen. This is additive, and it does
    not feed `peak_resident_bytes` -> `footprints.py` -> `fit.py`, so no
    model's "measured" verdict moves because of it.

    NOT `get_active_memory()` either, which is what the framework has handed
    out of its pool. After a render finishes MLX returns buffers to its own
    pool but NOT to the OS, so active collapses while the process still holds
    the memory. That exclusion is deliberate and correct for a COST figure
    (`mflux_image/worker.py`'s own comment, and D310 measured a ~23.6 GB pool
    against ~14.1 GB active) because it keeps runners comparable — torch
    reports what it allocated, not the driver's reservation. It simply does not
    apply to a live reading.

    STDLIB ONLY on darwin, via `ctypes` — no psutil, whose `memory_full_info()`
    does not expose `phys_footprint`. Both figures come out of the SAME
    `task_vm_info` read (offsets 16 and 144), so they describe the same instant
    and the max cannot be taken across two moments. Falls back to psutil's RSS
    wherever no such counter exists (every non-macOS platform, and any darwin
    failure above), and to None if even that is unavailable: never a guess, the
    same rule the other two probes follow.

    **`_footprint`'s figure is ADDED to the platform figure above, not `max`ed
    into it** — a deliberate DIFFERENT rule from the `max` this function
    already takes between `phys_footprint` and `resident_size`. Those two
    OVERLAP (same `task_vm_info` read, so whichever is bigger already includes
    everything the smaller one counted); a Linux worker's RSS and a discrete
    GPU's VRAM do not — they are disjoint address spaces, and `psutil` cannot
    see the driver's allocation at all. Taking `max` of two disjoint figures
    would silently discard the smaller one from the total; summing is the
    better lower bound, which is all this function has ever promised to be.
    See `_footprint`'s own docstring for the measured numbers this closes the
    gap for (a ROCm/FLUX.2-klein worker: 11.7 GiB of weights in RSS, 0.59 GiB
    of driver context invisible to it) and why the hook itself never fires on
    darwin/MPS, where `phys_footprint` already counts that pool.

# per file and one file at a time, so a model whose bytes are a single 4.6GB
# shard downloads on exactly one connection — and an interruption throws the
# whole thing away, which matters because the supervisor kills the fetch on quit
# (AI-5e). What is below fetches with several connections at once, split across
# files AND inside one file with `Range`, recording per-segment offsets as the
# bytes land. Every failure and every incapability falls back to
# `snapshot_download` under the same progress wrapper: a download that got
# faster and sometimes broken would be a bad trade.

#: Below this a file is fetched whole: splitting a 200KB config across four
#: sockets costs four round trips to save nothing.
SEGMENT_MIN_BYTES = 32 * 1024 * 1024
#: The size of one unit of work once a file IS being split. A separate
#: constant from `SEGMENT_MIN_BYTES` on purpose, even though the two start out
#: equal: one decides whether to split a file at all, the other decides how
#: big each piece is once splitting happens, and nothing says a future tuning
#: pass changes them together.
#:
#: **A FLOOR, not the size — see `MAX_CHUNKS_PER_FILE`.** Every piece is exactly
#: this big up to a file of `500 × CHUNK_BYTES` (16,777,216,000 bytes, ~16.8GB);
#: above that the piece grows so that the COUNT stops. Everything below is about
#: why a fixed size rather than `size / N`, and it holds unchanged: the point was
#: never 32MB specifically, it was many more units of work than connections.
#:
#: **Fixed size, not `size / N` — this is the fix for the download's tail.**
#: A big shard used to become a handful of EQUAL shares (see the retired
#: `MAX_SEGMENTS_PER_FILE` below): four connections at four different real
#: speeds finish at four different times, and once the fast three are done
#: there is nothing left to hand them — the slowest share runs out the clock
#: alone, which measured as a 4.6GB model crawling from ~90% to 100% for over
#: a minute. Fixed-size chunks make a big file into MANY units of work in one
#: shared queue: a worker that finishes early pulls the next chunk rather than
#: finding nothing assigned to it, so a slow connection only ever delays its
#: own current 32MB, never the tail of the whole download.
#:
#: **Two costs this accepts, deliberately, both raised in review and both
#: judged worth it rather than left unexamined.**
#:
#: (1) A 4.6GB shard is now ~144 requests instead of 4 — 144 TCP/TLS
#: handshakes rather than 4, since `urllib` opens a fresh connection per
#: `_open` call. Against a 32MB transfer per chunk that overhead is a small
#: percentage, and it buys the one property size/N could not have at any
#: chunk count: MORE units of work than `MAX_CONNECTIONS`, which is what
#: makes stealing possible at all. A pool with only as many items as workers
#: — four shares on eight connections — can never exhibit the failure this
#: fixes, no matter how the four are sized.
#:
#: (2) `work` is built file-by-file (`_segmented_fetch`), so with one file's
#: chunk count at or above `MAX_CONNECTIONS`, all 8 connections work that ONE
#: file before the next file's chunks start — files finish roughly in
#: submission order rather than interleaved. That is a scheduling preference,
#: not a correctness gap: the cap still holds, nothing waits on a connection
#: sitting idle, and a multi-file repo still finishes strictly faster than
#: before this change. Round-robining chunks ACROSS files instead would
#: trade "finishes files one at a time" for "every file creeps up together",
#: which is not obviously better and was not what the tail bug asked for —
#: left as a real option for whoever next has a reason to prefer it, not
#: implemented speculatively here.
CHUNK_BYTES = 32 * 1024 * 1024
#: The most pieces ONE file may be split into, whatever its size. Together with
#: the floor above:
#:
#:     chunk = max(CHUNK_BYTES, ceil(size / MAX_CHUNKS_PER_FILE))
#:
#: so a file grows its piece SIZE once it would otherwise grow its piece COUNT
#: past this. The floor and the ceiling meet at exactly `500 × CHUNK_BYTES` —
#: 16,777,216,000 bytes, ~16.8GB — and every file below that is chunked exactly
#: as it was before this cap existed, which is every model in today's catalog
#: and every file of the 280-file `MiniMaxAI/MiniMax-H3` (its largest plans 311
#: pieces, so the cap never engages there at all).
#:
#: **The cost this removes is SIDECAR BOOKKEEPING, and nothing else.** Every
#: segment's cursor lives in the sidecar, which is rewritten whole every
#: `FLUSH_EVERY_S` (one second) for the life of the download. `Comfy-Org/MiniMax-H3`
#: — 30 files, 471GB, with single files up to 66.3GB — planned 1,976 segments in
#: one file and 14,057 across the repo: serialising ~2,000 dicts on a 1Hz timer
#: for the several hours such a download runs, per file in flight. Capped, that
#: same 66.3GB file is 500 × 133MB.
#:
#: **It is NOT a rate-limit measure and must not be read as one.** The Hub meters
#: URLs carrying a `/resolve/` segment; our ranged GETs go to the presigned CDN
#: location, which carries none, so chunk count consumes no quota at all. The
#: metered cost of a download is about one metadata resolve per FILE (280 for the
#: largest MiniMax repo, against 3,000 per five minutes anonymously), which no
#: chunking decision changes. What protects against rate limits is the Hub token,
#: the `RateLimit` parse in `_throttle_wait_s`, and `_resolved_meta`.
#:
#: **Why this does not reintroduce `_RETIRED_MAX_SEGMENTS_PER_FILE`'s tail
#: problem.** That cap was 4 — at or below `MAX_CONNECTIONS = 8`, so a big file
#: became a handful of static shares and a worker that finished early had nothing
#: to steal. 500 units against 8 connections is still sixty times more work than
#: workers, which is the property the tail fix actually needed; a queue that deep
#: hands off exactly as well as an uncapped one.
#:
#: **The accepted cost:** a failed chunk re-fetches a whole chunk, so at the
#: 66.3GB extreme that is up to 133MB rather than 32MB. It only applies above
#: ~16.8GB, where 133MB is two tenths of a percent of the file, and the retry
#: loop's own budget (`SEGMENT_ATTEMPTS`) already makes exactly this trade one
#: size down.
MAX_CHUNKS_PER_FILE = 500
#: Across everything — the ONE number that bounds how many sockets a download
#: opens. A pool per file would multiply the caps together.
MAX_CONNECTIONS = 8
#: RETIRED, deliberately left named rather than silently deleted: this used to
#: cap a single file at 4 equal shares, back when segments were `size / N`.
#: With fixed-size `CHUNK_BYTES` chunks pulled from one GLOBAL queue, a big
#: file simply produces more chunks — that is the whole fix above — and
#: `MAX_CONNECTIONS` is what already bounds how many run at once, so a second,
#: per-file cap would only recreate the tail this redesign removes: capping a
#: 4.6GB shard at 4 chunks again puts it back on 4 static shares. Nothing
#: reads this constant; it stays as a marker for why the number is gone.
_RETIRED_MAX_SEGMENTS_PER_FILE = 4
#: Deliberately NOT hf's `.incomplete`. hf resumes one of those by seeking to
#: its current length; our segments write out of order, so a partial file of
#: length N does not mean the first N bytes are there, and handing hf one of
#: ours would produce a silently corrupt blob. A suffix of our own also keeps
#: the fallback clean — hf never sees our state at all. On the append-only path
#: (`_appends_only`) length N *does* mean the first N bytes, but the suffix
#: stays ours on both: which of the two wrote a given part file is not something
#: hf could tell, and `_clear_parts` deletes them before the fallback runs
#: rather than offering hf a file whose meaning depends on the platform.
PART_SUFFIX = ".fusedpart"
#: `os.O_BINARY` where the platform has one, and 0 where the question does not
#: arise. **Windows only, and load-bearing exactly there.** A bare `os.open`
#: there gets the CRT's default translation mode, which is TEXT, so every `\n`
#: in a write becomes `\r\n` on the way to the disk. A weights blob is not text
#: — 0x0a is about one byte in 256 of one — so a part file written without this
#: flag is both LONGER than the file it describes and wrong in content, while
#: the cursors go on saying the download is complete: they count what was handed
#: to `os.write`, and the translation happens below that. The mirror path's
#: sha256 then declines a repo the Hub could serve, and the Hub path, which has
#: no digest, would publish a corrupt blob under a real etag — permanent, since
#: hf serves it from cache forever (`finish`). The stdlib does exactly this for
#: exactly this reason: `tempfile` ORs it into every one of its own flag sets.
#:
#: **Latent until the append-only route existed, and exposed rather than
#: introduced by it.** `os.pwrite` does not exist on the one platform where the
#: flag matters, so before `_appends_only` no `os.open` in this file had ever
#: written a byte there. Windows CI found it the first time one did.
_BINARY = getattr(os, "O_BINARY", 0)
#: SPEC AI-29 (D533) — refuses to open a `.part` path that is a SYMLINK,
#: rather than a regular file, without rejecting a legitimate RESUME (the
#: whole reason `O_EXCL`/`create_new` cannot be used here, unlike a one-shot
#: temp file: a `.part` file is deliberately reopened across process
#: restarts, sidecar-tracked, so "already exists" cannot mean "reject" the
#: way it would for a throwaway file). `O_NOFOLLOW` blocks exactly the attack
#: this item's checklist names — a symlink pre-planted at the `.part` path
#: to redirect writes elsewhere — while a real, previously-created `.part`
#: file (never a symlink; nothing in this module ever creates one there)
#: keeps opening normally. Absent on Windows (`getattr` default 0, the same

#: says the opposite — the server is reachable and is asking us to wait — so it
#: gets an allowance of its own, counted separately. With the shared budget, a
#: throttled download gave up after five attempts and about seven seconds of
#: backoff and fell into `snapshot_download`, which is SLOWER: the user saw a
#: download crawl for no stated reason, having been throttled and never told.
#:
#: **THE REAL GUARANTEE IS THE TIME, NOT THE COUNT.** `THROTTLE_TOTAL_MAX_S` is
#: the bound worth reasoning about — the most wall clock one stretch of being
#: rate-limited may cost before this gives up and lets the ordinary failure path
#: hand the repo to hf. The attempt count bounds the REQUESTS instead, for the
#: pathological case the time budget cannot see: a server naming a wait of a

#: finding — 60 attempts × a 60s ceiling is an hour, which is exactly what the

#: that stays accountable in minute-sized pieces. The wait is slept in

#:
#: **3: `MAX_CHUNKS_PER_FILE`.** A file above `500 × CHUNK_BYTES` (~16.8GB) is

#: `ceil(size/500)`. Every SMALLER file is planned identically, so nothing but
#: the version number distinguishes a stale sidecar from a current one, which is
#: exactly the dangerous shape described below.
#:
#: **2: the chunk queue.** A segment used to be one of `size / N` equal shares,
#: and became one of many fixed-size `CHUNK_BYTES` pieces, so a sidecar an older
#: build left behind describes boundaries this build would derive differently for
#: the same file. Identity
#: (etag, size) still matches such a sidecar, and the layout even often looks
#: internally consistent — which is exactly the shape of input that turns a
#: resume into a silently wrong blob rather than an obviously failed one, so
#: it cannot be left to the layout check to notice. Anything read back with a
#: different number, MISSING included — every sidecar written before this

#: correct, merely slower than a resume would have been.

    True where there is no `os.pwrite`, which means Windows and nothing else.

    Segments write OUT OF ORDER into a file that was pre-sized before a byte
    arrived, and only an unbuffered positional write makes AI-5i's guarantee
    hold there — that a counted byte is a written byte. `seek` + `write` on a
    buffered handle does not: the count runs ahead of the disk, and a resume
    then skips bytes that were never durable.

    So this used to be a flat refusal, and the refusal cost the model mirror its
    entire purpose on that platform: the mirror's only transport is
    `_segmented_fetch`, so a Windows client declined every time, every
    acquisition went to the Hub, and none of them appeared in the access logs
    the feature exists to produce (AI-5l).

    **A single append-only stream keeps the same guarantee by a different route
    rather than giving it up.** With one segment and an `O_APPEND` fd there is
    no out-of-order write left to make: every `os.write` is a syscall landing at
    the END of the file, so the file's LENGTH is the progress and a resume is a
    `Range` from that length. Nothing is buffered and nothing is seeked — the
    two things the pre-sized layout needed `pwrite` to avoid. What that also
    removes is the pre-sized file itself, and with it the sparse-filesystem
    requirement (`_segmented_fetch`) and the reason the bar counts blocks rather
    than length (`bytes_on_disk`).

    What is given up is parallelism WITHIN one file, and only that: chunks of
    DIFFERENT files still run on `MAX_CONNECTIONS` streams, because two files
    are two fds and nothing between them is out of order. A repo of thirty
    shards is as parallel here as anywhere; a single 4.6GB shard is not.

    Asked at call time rather than cached at import: it is one `hasattr`, and
    the tests answer it by taking the attribute away from a module they have

    is nothing to gain from splitting a file too small to matter.

    At or above it, every piece but the last is exactly one chunk — fixed
    size, not `size / N`. A fixed size is what turns a big file into MANY
    units of work rather than a HANDFUL: the whole point, since a queue with
    only as many items as connections gives a slow one nothing to hand off
    once its faster siblings finish (see `CHUNK_BYTES`'s own comment). A
    30-shard repo and a single 4.6GB shard both resolve to plans a worker can
    keep pulling from until the file is actually done.

    The chunk is `CHUNK_BYTES` up to the point where that would mean more than
    `MAX_CHUNKS_PER_FILE` pieces, and grows from there — a floor on the size and
    a ceiling on the count, which is what keeps a 66GB file's sidecar from

    **PER FILE, and not per repo, deliberately.** A repo-wide budget would make
    one file's chunk size depend on the rest of the FILE SET, and this function
    is deterministic in `size` alone — no `count` argument, unlike the
    equal-share split it replaced. That is what lets a resume regenerate the
    exact boundaries a previous run planned without persisting the piece count
    anywhere but the sidecar's own `segments` list; under a per-repo cap, a
    resume after any change to the file list (a scoped download, an

        ONE segment covering the whole file, an fd opened `O_APPEND`, and no
        `ftruncate` to the final size. Those are the only three differences from
        `plan()` above and they are all one difference: **here the part file's
        LENGTH is the progress**, where on the segmented path the length is
        final from the first second and the cursors are the progress.

        That is how AI-5i's invariant is kept rather than traded away. A counted
        byte must be a byte the kernel already has, which is why out-of-order
        segments need an unbuffered positional write; a single sequential stream
        gets the same promise from `O_APPEND` itself, since every `os.write`
        lands at the end of the file and the end of the file is the only cursor
        there is. A `SIGKILL` therefore leaves a PREFIX — never a file with a
        hole in the middle that a length would misdescribe.

        The sidecar still licenses the resume, exactly as above: without one this
        part file is bytes of unknown provenance. And the one segment derived
        here is also what refuses a sidecar the SEGMENTED path wrote — four
        recorded segments against one derived, so `_restore` says no and the file
        restarts whole. It has to: that part file is pre-sized and full of holes,
        and appending onto it would publish a blob of exactly the right length
        and partly wrong content. The refusal holds in the other direction too,
        in `_saved`.

        Then the recorded cursor and the file are made to AGREE before a byte
        moves, by truncating the file back to the cursor. `flush` fsyncs the data
        before it writes the sidecar, so a recorded offset is always durable
        while the last second of writes may not be — a distinction the segmented
        path keeps by resuming from the recorded offset and overwriting anything
        past it positionally. Appending cannot overwrite, so the un-vouched-for
        tail goes instead: at most one flush interval of bytes re-fetched,
        against a resume that would otherwise append at a length no sidecar ever
        recorded.

        rather than `size / N` equal shares — so a sidecar an older build
        wrote can have the right etag, the right size, and a layout that still
        passes the shape check in `_restore`, while every offset in it means a
        different byte than this build would derive for the same file. Etag
        and size agreeing says nothing about that; only the version does. A
        missing `version` — every sidecar written before this field existed —
        reads as a mismatch by construction, since `state.get` returns `None`
        and `None != SIDECAR_VERSION`.

        Identity next — etag, size, and a part file still as long as it was —
        because a sidecar belonging to a different revision of the file would
        have us skip bytes that were never fetched, and the result is a blob of
        exactly the right length that is silently wrong. The layout itself is
        checked in `_restore`, against the segments derived from this answer.

        **The part-file LENGTH check belongs to the pre-sized layout, so it is
        skipped on the append-only path** (`_appends_only`), where a part file
        shorter than the file it describes is the ordinary case — its length is
        the progress. Skipping it is not a hole: the two layouts still refuse to
        resume each other's part files, in both directions. A segmented run
        handed an APPENDED part file sees a short file where a pre-sized one is
        required and starts clean; an appending run handed a SEGMENTED one gets
        past this check and is refused by `_restore`, which derives one segment
        against the sidecar's many. Either way the answer is "no sidecar", which
        is only ever slower.

        **`isinstance(state, dict)` is checked explicitly, not left to fall out
        of a `KeyError`.** A sidecar whose JSON parses but is not an object — a
        truncated write that still happens to be valid JSON on its own, like a
        bare `2` or a list — has no `.get`, and `state["etag"]` on such a value
        raises `TypeError`, not `KeyError`; both were already caught here, so
        this was harmless before the version check was added. `state.get(...)`
        on a non-dict raises `AttributeError`, which was NOT in the tuple below
        — so a malformed sidecar stopped reading as "no sidecar" for this one
        file and instead escaped `plan()` entirely, taking the whole repo into
        the fallback and `_clear_parts` deleting every OTHER file's progress
        along with it. Checking the shape up front says directly what every

        length is right from the first second and a sparse file of pure holes
        passes a size check — which would put a zero-filled blob under a real
        etag into the hub cache, where hf serves it from cache forever. The
        cursors are the same durable-byte accounting the sidecar records, and
        they are the only evidence there is that the file is whole.

        On the append-only path (`_appends_only`) the length happens to agree
        with the cursors, and the gate is still the cursors: ONE rule rather
        than a per-platform one, and the cursors are the stricter of the two
        anyway — `_whole_body` can rewind them, and a length that had not been
        rewound with them is exactly the state this must not publish.

        No hash on the HUB path, like huggingface_hub itself, which relies on TLS
        and `Content-Length`: re-reading every gigabyte off the disk would give
        back a good part of what this feature is for.

        **The MIRROR path is hashed, and the trade is genuinely different there.**
        A `sha256` in the metadata is what marks it (the Hub cannot give us one;
        see `mirror.file_meta`). On that path we are the origin, so nobody else
        would ever notice a bad byte we shipped — a corrupt upload, a truncated
        object, a cache poisoned somewhere between us and the user — and a wrong
        blob filed under a real etag is not a failed download but a PERMANENT
        one: hf's own loaders then serve those bytes out of the cache forever,
        and no later download would refetch them. One re-read of the file we just
        wrote, once, against a digest we generated from the same blob hf produced,
        is what makes that impossible.

        Verified BEFORE `os.replace`, not after. A blob is published the instant
        it is renamed, and a concurrent load can pick it up between the rename
        and any check that follows — so the check that has to hold is the one on
        the part file, where a failure leaves nothing in the cache to clean up.

    """Fetch `filenames` into the hub cache ourselves. Returns the snapshot dir.

    `meta` and `token` are the two seams a non-Hub source needs, and both
    default to today's behaviour exactly. `meta` supplies the per-file metadata
    (see `_resolve`); `token` is the credential the requests carry, and the
    mirror path passes `None` for it — `_cdn_token` sends the Hub token whenever
    the blob URL IS the metadata URL, which is true of our own mirror by
    construction, and a user's Hub token has no business being offered to
    whatever host `FUSED_MODEL_MIRROR` names.

    Everything else is deliberately NOT a seam. The one-commit check, the
    asked-for-commit pin, the sparse-file requirement and the ref write are what
    make a fetch a SNAPSHOT rather than a pile of files, and they hold whoever
    supplied the metadata — all the more so for a manifest we read off a CDN.

    `revision` is REQUIRED and has no default on purpose: it must be the commit
    the caller's file list resolved to, and a default here is exactly how a list
    taken from one revision came to be fetched at another. `ref` is the branch
    NAME that resolved to it, recorded so a later offline load can resolve the
    same name — hf writes that ref too, and a cache without it needs the network
    to answer a question it already knows.

    The units of work in the pool are SEGMENTS ACROSS ALL FILES under one cap,
    which is what makes `MAX_CONNECTIONS` mean what it says: a pool per file
    would multiply the two caps together and open thirty sockets on a repo of
    thirty shards.

    **A platform with no `os.pwrite` fetches each file on one append-only
    stream instead of splitting it** (`_appends_only`), and that is the only
    thing it changes: the queue, the cap and this pool are untouched, so the
    serialization is per FILE and a repo of shards still moves on
    `MAX_CONNECTIONS` connections. It used to be an `_Unsegmentable` refusal
    here, which quietly meant the model mirror never fetched on Windows and no
    Windows acquisition ever reached our access logs (AI-5l).

    **No cache lock, unlike `snapshot_download`, and deliberately.** Two app
    instances fetching one repo would write the SAME bytes at the SAME offsets:
    the etag names the content, so there is no version of this race that puts
    wrong bytes in a blob. What can happen is wasted work — one instance's
    `os.replace` pulls the part file out from under the other, whose next
    syscall fails and whose download falls back to hf — and that costs a slower
    download, never a corrupt cache. Inside one app it cannot happen at all:
    the supervisor's deterministic job id joins a second Download of a model

    and then sit in the hub cache forever beside the blob hf finished: nothing
    ever resumes into a part file whose blob already exists.

    **Ours only, and immediate — the opposite of `_sweep_orphan_parts` on both
    counts, deliberately.** hf's own `.incomplete` is left alone here regardless
    of age. In the huggingface_hub actually installed (1.29.0 in this venv;

    `<blob>.<8 hex chars>.incomplete` — and `_download_to_tmp_and_move` unlinks
    it itself, in a `finally`, on any ordinary failure; a leftover `.incomplete`
    is therefore evidence of a hard kill or crash, not of a resumable transfer,
    and even then nothing will ever seek into it by that exact random name
    again. Whether an older or future hf ever resumes by seeking into a shared
    name is not a guarantee this file can make for every version it might run

    hf's own leftovers here. Their eventual removal is entirely
    `_sweep_orphan_parts`'s job, on ITS terms (a grace window, and only after
    some scope's download has actually succeeded) — see there for why that is
    the right call despite the cost.

    There is no grace window of its own here for the same reason age would add
    nothing to a same-process check: the segmented fetch that just failed is
    definitely not writing into its own part file any more.

    So the resume story this function is party to is honest about its scope.
    It removes only what THIS failed attempt was writing, and defers to
    `_sweep_orphan_parts` for everything else in the repo — including anything
    an app kill, quit or crash left behind (AI-5e), which is why a fetch that

    `hf_xet` (installed in every runner venv; every mlx-community repo is
    Xet-backed) delivers bytes in BURSTS rather than a steady trickle:
    measured on a 481MB repo, `bytes_on_disk` sat on one number for 6 seconds,
    then jumped ~90MB, then landed the final ~45% all at once on completion.
    Scaled to a 4.6GB model that is a bar parked on one number for a MINUTE
    while the download is perfectly healthy — the "stuck at 98%" report. hf
    knows the true count the whole time; this reads it through the one seam
    hf exposes for exactly that, and the disk walk stays as the heartbeat and
    the fallback for whatever this cannot read.

    **The outer bar is a file counter, and reporting it as bytes is the
    original AI-5b trap one level further in.** `snapshot_download` hands its
    `tqdm_class` to THREE distinct bars: one wrapping `hf_thread_map` over the
    file list — `desc="Fetching N files"`, no `unit` at all, one `.update(1)`
    per file — and two created directly for BYTES, `unit="B"`, one per
    conceptual stream (`_create_progress_bar` in hf's own `_snapshot_download`
    and `_xet_progress_reporting`). `unit == "B"` is what tells them apart:
    when `unit` is absent it is the file counter, which is exactly how "10 /
    11 B" happened before — the same bug this feature exists to fix,
    reappearing one seam further in.

    **Two byte streams, not one, and they must not be SUMMED.** hf's Xet path
    reports network TRANSFER (`desc` containing "downloading bytes") and disk
    RECONSTRUCTION (`desc` containing "reconstruct") separately — both cover
    close to the same total under dedup/compression, so adding them can read
    past 100% of a file that is not yet done. `bytes_on_disk` means "landed on
    disk", which is what the reconstruction stream already means, so ticks
    into the "reconstruct" bucket and the "transfer" bucket are kept apart and
    the counter reports whichever is FURTHER ALONG — never their sum. A plain
    `http_get` download (no Xet) hands back exactly one bar, whose `desc` is a
    filename and matches neither keyword; it lands in the transfer bucket,
    which is exactly the bytes it wrote, so the two-bucket split costs nothing
    on that path.

    `seen` is False until some byte bar reports ANYTHING, which is what lets
    the caller tell "no usable counter" (an hf version that reports
    differently, or ignores `tqdm_class` altogether, or a fetch that never
    goes near hf's downloaders at all) from "the counter says zero because
    nothing has landed yet" — the two must not be confused, or a slow start
    would look like this feature having failed rather than a download that is
    merely early.

    """Run `call()` on a thread, reporting progress once a second.

    `call` is whatever huggingface_hub function actually fetches — a whole
    snapshot for one runner, a single GGUF file for another — and this is the
    part neither of them should write twice: the poll is the progress AND the
    heartbeat, without which a long single-file download reports nothing for
    minutes and the manager calls the row abandoned. The ONE-SECOND TICK is
    unconditional regardless of what drives `done` below it — the tick itself
    is the heartbeat (AI-5h), and a fetch that happens to have a live byte
    counter must keep beating exactly as often as one that does not.

    `counter`, when given, is a `_HubByteTicker` whose `tqdm_class` `call` was
    built to pass to hf's own downloader. Once it has `seen` anything, `done`
    is `max(counter.value, bytes_on_disk(folder))` rather than the disk walk
    alone — never less than either, so a counter that stalls while the disk
    still advances (or the reverse) cannot make the bar go backwards. Before
    it has seen anything — no counter at all, an hf version that reports
    differently, a `tqdm_class` silently ignored — this degrades to exactly
    the disk-walk-only behaviour from before it existed. See `_HubByteTicker`
    for why a byte counter existing at all used to be exactly the AI-5b trap
    ("10 / 11 B") one level further in.

    **`job`/`row` exist because not every fetch belongs to a download job.** A
    runner that pulls a component model DURING a request — the speech detector,
    the two diarization models — is reporting into a row the supervisor opened
    for a transcription, not into this process's `JOB_ID` (which is the model's
    own load row, long since finished). `job` sends the tick to the right row;
    `row` is that row's IDENTITY (`supervisor.transcribe_row_fields`), restated
    on every tick because the manager can evict and rebuild any row at any tick
    and a report with no `title` is refused outright.

    `kind`/`unit` are this function's own and override the row's, deliberately:
    for the length of the fetch the row IS a download and 6MB of 26MB is what a
    person wants to see. The next tick from the work itself restates the row's
    own pair, so the flip is for the duration and not a rename.

    **The tick carries the ✕ back**, and that became load-bearing the moment a
    fetch could land on a transcription row. It ticked with a plain `report`
    while these fetches owned a model-load row, whose ✕ the supervisor answers
    by killing the process — so nothing here had to. A component fetch reports
    into a row whose `cancellable` is True and whose ✕ must stop THIS work, and
    with a plain `report` the user pressed it, the manager set
    `cancel_requested`, and 33MB carried on downloading behind a row that went
    on saying "running". The reply to the tick we were sending anyway is the
    only channel that reaches a thread parked inside huggingface_hub.

    `CANCEL` is consulted too, but ONLY when `job` was passed. That flag is the
    `/cancel` route's, it belongs to the generation holding `GENERATE_LOCK`, and
    it is cleared by `_single`/`_stream` on the way in — so it means this fetch
    exactly when this fetch is inside a request. A model download runs on
    `_bring_up`'s own thread with no such lock, where a flag left set by an
    earlier cancelled generation would abort a download nobody asked to stop.

    **A ✕ that lands as the fetch FINISHES is not honoured**, which is the same
    rule `_call_with_ticks` states: the bytes are on the disk, and throwing them
    away would make the next attempt re-download what this one already has. So
    the final report is a plain `report`. The abandoned fetch thread is a
    daemon nobody waits for — it finishes into a result that is discarded, and
    huggingface_hub resumes partial files, so the bytes are not lost either.

# ------------------------------------------------------- the already-cached path
#
# **A model already complete on disk is resolved WITHOUT touching the network**,
# and the reason is that "Fetching weights…" for a cached model was costing about
# a second of wall clock before any weight was read. Measured on this machine for
# `mlx-community/whisper-tiny.en-8bit`, fully cached: `download_snapshot` 483ms
# and `download_file` 456ms, against ~14ms for the actual `load()` inside
# mlx-whisper. All of it is Hub round-trips — `HfApi().model_info(files_metadata=
# True)` is 228ms on its own and hf's own `snapshot_download` spends another
# ~220ms revalidating etags — and it is also the source of the "You are sending
# unauthenticated requests to the HF Hub" line in every worker log. The same two
# answers off the cache alone are 0.13ms and 0.14ms.
#
# **The trade, stated so the next reader does not have to rediscover it: a model
# already complete on disk will NOT pick up a newer Hub revision.** Nothing here
# re-checks `main` once the cache can answer, so a repo that was re-uploaded
# under the same branch keeps serving the bytes this machine already has until
# something else forces a re-check (a cache clear, a fetch of a file this
# snapshot does not have, or a caller that scopes the download differently).
# That is deliberate (D367): bring-up latency and working offline are worth more
# here than revision freshness, because these are pinned model snapshots a user
# downloaded on purpose rather than a moving dependency — and a silently changing
# set of weights under a name the user chose would be the worse surprise anyway.
#
# What must NOT change is a first download, and that is the whole shape of this:
# the local attempt either answers completely or it is discarded, and everything
# below it — the metadata call, the total, the segmented fetch, the progress
# reporting — runs exactly as it did before.
#
# **What "complete" can and cannot mean without a listing** — this is the part a
# code review corrected, and the correction is the reason for the two rules
# below. hf's own completeness check (`_raise_if_incomplete_snapshot`) verifies
# the snapshot against `trees/<commit>.json`, and hf's own comment says that with
# no tree listing cached "we cannot tell, so we do nothing". `_segmented_fetch`
# never writes one: it publishes blobs and hand-writes `refs/<branch>`
# (`_write_ref`), and it is the NORMAL path — hf's downloader runs only on
# fallback. So for essentially every repo this app fetched itself, hf's check is a
# no-op, and it must not be counted as evidence. It was, in the first cut of this,
# and the claim that the gap was unreachable was simply wrong.
#
# **So this app records its own fetches, and the fast path answers only from that
# record.** `_record_fetch` writes `<repo folder>/.fused-fetch-<commit>.json` when a
# download completes, holding the SCOPE it was asked for and the file names the
# LISTING asked for — verified present at write time, and not written at all if they
# are not (see `_record_fetch`: a list built from what happened to land would be
# self-certifying). `_cached_path` serves a request only when the record is for the
# commit hf resolved, at the scope being asked for, and every recorded name is
# present and settled. That makes "nothing would be downloaded" a claim about the
# disk rather than an inference from it, and it is what the two earlier attempts
# were reaching for:
#
# * **Scoping is a property of the on-disk STATE, not of the call.** Refusing
#   scoped CALLS — the previous rule — left the reachable half open, because the
#   same repo id reaches BOTH kinds of call: `diffusers_image` fetches
#   `black-forest-labs/FLUX.2-klein-4B` scoped to `recipe["keep"]`, and
#   `mflux_image.download` fetches whatever id it is given unscoped, with
#   `/api/ai/runtime/download` choosing between them from the user's image-engine
#   preference and `weights_only=True` stopping before the `load()` that would
#   refuse the format. A download on the MLX engine after one on the Diffusers
#   engine would have been answered from a cache holding a tenth of the repo,
#   reporting success having fetched nothing. The same flip needs no user at all if
#   a recipe is ever REMOVED: `download()` takes its unscoped branch against a
#   still-scoped cache, and `from_pretrained` fails on a component nobody fetched.
#   A recorded scope answers both — and lets a scoped call USE the fast path when
#   the scope on disk is its own.
# * **A file that went away has to be DETECTABLE.** A blob pruned together with its
#   snapshot entry leaves nothing for a walk of the snapshot to trip over; only a
#   list of what should be there catches it. Before this path existed, pressing
#   Download again re-listed and re-fetched exactly that, so short-circuiting
#   without the list quietly removed the app's only repair route. Checking recorded
#   NAMES also makes the verification exact instead of structural: nothing depends
#   on `os.walk`, which does not follow directory symlinks by default and so used
#   to refuse a snapshot whose files sit under a linked subdirectory — a fast path
#   wrongly declined rather than wrongly taken, but wrong.
# * **`_settled` per name**, which is where an interrupted download's part files
#   are ruled out — per BLOB rather than per repo, for the reason `_settled` gives.
#
# A cache with no record — every machine that already holds models when this ships
# — takes the networked path exactly as before and gains one on the way out, so the
# next bring-up is the fast one. No migration step, and no cache is ever served on
# the strength of a record this app did not write.
#
# **Two further rules the first cut got wrong, both about not doing MORE than
# looking.** (1) A repo the cache has never held must not reach a hub download
# function at all, not even with `local_files_only=True`: `tests/test_ai_hub_
# fetch.py` states the invariant that pressing Stop must not start a download,
# and it enforces it by counting `snapshot_download`/`hf_hub_download` calls —
# correctly, because "we only passed local_files_only" is precisely the kind of
# claim that stops being true when an argument gets dropped in a refactor. So the
# gate is a plain filesystem look FIRST (`_has_cached_snapshot`,
# `try_to_load_from_cache`), and hf is consulted only once the cache is known to
# hold something for this repo. (2) `Cancelled` must never be read as "not
# cached". It is an ordinary `Exception`, so a bare `except Exception` here turned
# a ✕ into "fall back to the network" — which is the one degradation this file
# forbids everywhere else, because it starts a fresh multi-gigabyte download out
# of pressing Stop. `_NOT_CACHED` is therefore an explicit tuple, and every hub
# answer that means "the cache cannot serve this" is inside it.

#: What "the cache cannot answer" arrives as, and nothing else.
#:
#: Both of hf's own verdicts are `OSError` subclasses, checked against
#: huggingface_hub 1.28: `LocalEntryNotFoundError` is
#: `(EntryNotFoundError, FileNotFoundError)` and `IncompleteSnapshotError` — a
#: snapshot its tree listing says is missing files — derives from that. A cache
#: directory this process cannot read is an `OSError` too, and an `ImportError` is
#: what a venv without the library looks like.
#:
#: **Named as a tuple rather than caught broadly on purpose**: `Cancelled` is a
#: plain `Exception` and is exactly what must NOT be swallowed here (see above),
#: and neither is a `KeyboardInterrupt` or a bug in this file. A hub version that
#: invents a new not-cached error outside this tuple costs a slow bring-up; a
#: `Cancelled` inside it costs the user a download they pressed Stop on.
_NOT_CACHED = (OSError, ImportError)

_HF_PART_SUFFIX = ".incomplete"

#: Every part-file SHAPE a fetch can leave beside a blob: ours — `.fusedpart`,
#: its offsets sidecar, and the sidecar's own `.tmp` (`_FileFetch.flush` writes
#: `<sidecar>.tmp` and `os.replace`s it over the sidecar; a crash between those
#: two steps leaves the `.tmp` behind with nothing else ever removing it) — and
#: hf's own `.incomplete`, unanchored on any prefix so it matches whether or
#: not the installed hf version infixes a per-attempt random name before the
#: suffix (`<etag>.incomplete` and `<etag>.<8 hex chars>.incomplete` both end
#: in `.incomplete`, so one alternative covers both; there is no shape here

#: can park a segment on a 429 for up to that long without a single byte

    anything this download cared about — it is resume state for a file some
    OTHER fetch, wider or narrower, earlier or concurrent-but-abandoned, was
    writing. No etag-to-filename mapping is needed to tell the two apart, and
    none is possible offline: the sidecar records only version/etag/size/
    segments, and hf's `.incomplete` carries no sidecar at all.

    **The trade-off, stated plainly.** "Some OTHER fetch" includes a
    `Cancelled` one — a paused download IS an out-of-scope part file with a
    stale mtime, and its whole reason to exist is to be resumed later (AI-5i).
    Once it is old enough and a sibling scope over the same repo succeeds,
    this removes it same as any other orphan, and that sibling's success
    restarts the paused download from zero the next time it is resumed. That
    is accepted, not overlooked: the alternative is a card that can read
    "partial" forever because the one thing standing in the way is resume
    state for a download nobody is coming back to finish, and there is no way
    from here to tell those two cases apart offline. A successful download
    over a repo clears every OTHER scope's leftover resume state in that
    repo — deliberately, as the cost of never leaving a card stuck.

    This is the fix for the recipe-scoped GGUF case: an earlier, unscoped fetch
    of a repo that later gains a `keep`-limited recipe leaves part files for
    the files the recipe now permanently excludes, and nothing scoped to the
    recipe ever looks at those names again to clean them up. Calling this after
    that scope's own success — the `_cached_path` fast path included, since a
    resume-button retry that changes nothing on the wire is exactly a repeat of
    that same success — removes them, and `hub_cache._unfinished_fetch` stops
    reading the repo as partial.

    **Only `blobs/`, never a full walk.** Every part file this module writes
    sits beside the blob it is filling (`_FileFetch.part`/`.sidecar`), and hf's
    `.incomplete` markers live in the same directory — nothing in this cache
    layout ever puts one anywhere else.

    **The grace window is the only guard against sweeping a file that is still
    being written.** There is no per-repo lock or in-flight registry here to
    consult instead: two fetches over the same repo — different recipe scopes,
    say — are two independent processes sharing nothing but the filesystem, so
    freshness is the only signal available. See `_PART_GRACE_SECONDS`.

    Never raises. A failed unlink is logged and skipped rather than swallowed —
    a cosmetic cleanup step must not be the thing that turns a successful
    download into a failed one, but it must not go silent either.

    `folder` is `None` when `repo_folder` could not import
    `huggingface_hub` (see its docstring) — checked explicitly, the same way

    when the phase is already complete on disk per this app's own
    completeness record (SPEC AI-5l's fast path in `download_snapshot`,
    reused rather than reimplemented).

    This is `download_plan`'s fix for the bug review caught: pricing every
    phase up front via a bare `repo_total_bytes()` call means an LTX bring-up
    with `mlx-community/gemma-3-12b-it-4bit` already cached contacted the Hub
    anyway, purely to price a phase that needed no network to answer at all
    — the exact "no metadata call, no etag revalidation" fast path
    `download_snapshot` documents for itself, silently defeated one level up
    by a pricing step that never checked. `_cached_path` is the SAME check
    (`local_files_only=True`, verified against our own fetch record) that
    function runs first, so a fully-offline bring-up with every phase already
    on disk now prices the whole plan without touching the network once.

    **Still not perfectly mirror-transparent.** A phase NOT in our own
    completeness record but servable entirely by `_mirror_snapshot` (AI-5l)
    still pays one Hub metadata call here before `download_snapshot`'s own
    mirror check gets a chance to run — `_mirror_snapshot` does not offer a
    cheap, network-free "would you serve this" probe separate from actually
    fetching, so there is no way to skip pricing for that case without either
    duplicating its logic or triggering the fetch itself twice. Narrower than
    the reported defect, which is specifically about an ALREADY-CACHED phase,
    and accepted rather than solved here.

    `phases` is an ordered list of `(model_id, allow_patterns, ignore_patterns)`
    — every repo one logical "Download" button touches. `ltx-video` fetches
    the LTX weights and then `mlx-community/gemma-3-12b-it-4bit` as two
    sequential `download_snapshot` calls; reporting only the first repo's
    total is AI-5b's original defect rebuilt one level up — true of a phase,
    silent about the download the button actually started.

    **The grand total is summed ONCE, before a byte moves**, from
    `_phase_total` per phase — the SAME call `download_snapshot` makes for
    its own scoped total when a phase is not already on disk, so a phase that
    only fetches part of a repo is priced against exactly what it fetches, in
    the sum as much as on its own. See `_phase_total`'s own docstring for how
    an already-complete phase is priced with no network at all.
    **A phase whose size cannot be answered costs the WHOLE total**, not
    just its own: `total` is `None` the moment any phase's is, rather than
    summing the KNOWN phases and pretending the rest cost nothing — that is
    AI-5b's defect rebuilt a second way, a bar priced at a fraction that jumps
    the instant the indeterminate phase's bytes start landing. Indeterminate is
    honest; partial is not.

    **Each phase still runs through `download_snapshot`, unmodified.** AI-5l's
    mirror branch, AI-5i's segmented fetch and the already-complete fast path
    all still apply per phase exactly as they do for a bare call — this
    function COMPOSES them, it does not reimplement any of them.

    **A second reporting layer rides alongside each phase's own, and the two
    are not coordinated.** `download_snapshot` has no way to know it is one of
    several phases, so it goes on reporting its OWN phase-scoped total on its
    OWN cadence (`fetch_with_progress`'s one-second tick) — reused code, not
    duplicated here. A background ticker corrects the row back to the GRAND
    total on a TIGHTER cadence (`_PLAN_TICK_S`) for the life of the whole
    plan, naming the phase in `detail` ("Fetching weights… (2 of 2)") and
    marking `total_scope="download"` so `modelSize.ts` knows this total may
    win outright rather than only ever raise the catalog's constant. Because
    the two tickers are independent, a viewer CAN catch a tick that briefly
    shows one phase's own smaller total before the next correction lands —
    reporting has always been best-effort here (see `report`'s own
    docstring), and the alternative is threading a "stay quiet" flag through
    `download_snapshot`'s three fetch paths (mirror, segmented, hub fallback)
    to suppress its own ticks, which is exactly the duplication this function
    exists to avoid. `_PLAN_TICK_S` keeps that window well under a second.

    **The closing tick only lands on SUCCESS.** A phase that raises — a
    network failure, or `Cancelled` from the ✕ — must not be followed by a
    tick claiming `done=<the grand total>`: that is a finished-download shape
    for a download that did not finish, the same lie a `state="running"`
    revival elsewhere in this file is written not to tell. `fetch_with_progress`
    itself never sends a closing tick on failure either — the exception is the
    report — and this function now matches it.
