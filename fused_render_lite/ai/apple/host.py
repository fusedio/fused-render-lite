"""The Apple tier's process host: one `fused-apple-ai` child per request.

Shaped like `server/ai.py`'s `_spawn_claude_stream` (a child per call, its
stdout read as NDJSON), NOT like a `registry.Runner`: the supervisor keeps ONE
worker per capability and evicts on engine mismatch, so an Apple "runner"
would evict the resident MLX model on every `provider: "apple"` call and be
evicted back on the next local one. The two tiers have to coexist, so this
tier spawns its own children and borrows only the job-row helpers.

One process per request, deliberately (D700 follow-up). The weights live in
the OS's own daemon, not in our child, so a spawn costs a spawn and nothing
else — and it removes the resident-server design's whole cost: no reader
thread, no per-request queues, no respawn logic, no cancel protocol.
Cancellation is `terminate()`; concurrency is two children.

Protocol: see the header of `helper/main.swift`.

**Where the binary comes from**, in order:
  1. `FUSED_RENDER_APPLE_HELPER` — an explicit path (CI, measurement builds).
  2. `Contents/MacOS/fused-apple-ai` beside the packaged interpreter — where
     `build_dmg.sh` puts the prebuilt helper (signed by the Mach-O sweep).
  3. `fused_render_lite/ai/apple/bin/fused-apple-ai` — a checkout's own build
     (`scripts/build_apple_helper.sh`), gitignored.
  4. A dev build on demand into `~/.fused-render/ai/apple/` when `swiftc`
     and a macOS 26 SDK are present; the probe says why when they are not.
