"""Hub `config.json` harvest, cached at ~/.fused-render/ai_hub_metadata.json
(SPEC AI-17, D518).

**Why this exists.** `hub_cache.has_vision_tower` and every KV-cache/fit
computation in `fit.py` need a model's architecture facts — layer count,
attention-head geometry, whether it carries a vision tower — but the ONLY
place those facts live before a download is `config.json` on the Hub, and
`hub_cache.py`'s equivalent reader (`_read_json` over a cached snapshot) can
only see a repo that is already ON DISK. A Hub *search* result never has that:
the AI Models page has to answer "will this fit, does it take images" for a
repo the user has not pulled a single byte of yet. `config.json` is a few KB —
no weights — so fetching it ahead of a decision to download is cheap enough to
do for every row a search returns, unlike a `HEAD` on the weight files
themselves.

**One HTTP GET, cached with a TTL, following the `bench_store.py` /
`footprints.py` idiom**: a private `_path()` over `storage.home_dir()`,
`storage.read_json`/`storage.write_json` and nothing else, a corrupt or
missing file reads as "nothing cached" and never raises. Unlike those two
modules this store is NOT machine-scoped — a repo's `config.json` describes
the MODEL, not the machine that asked for it, so there is no
`_same_machine`-style identity check and a home directory carried onto a new
laptop keeps a warm cache rather than discarding it.

**13-day TTL**, matching the analogous cache in the comparative study this
build was derived from (`llmfit`, read-only reference, not vendored) — a
`config.json` changes when a repo is re-published under the same id, which
happens on the order of weeks, not minutes; a shorter TTL would re-fetch on
every page load for no benefit, and a much longer one risks serving a stale
architecture across a repo's occasional in-place edit.

**A stale entry is served rather than discarded when the refetch itself
fails.** Network failure "degrades silently to no metadata" per spec, but that
rule is about a REPO WE HAVE NEVER SEEN — for one we have a two-week-old
reading of, going back to nothing on a transient DNS hiccup would regress a
page that used to answer into one that renders blank, which is worse than
serving a slightly-stale-but-still-correct answer. Only a repo with NO
prior SUCCESSFUL reading and a failed fetch reads as None.

**A failed fetch with nothing to fall back on is cached too, as a NEGATIVE
entry, under a much shorter `NEGATIVE_TTL_SECONDS`.** GGUF repos routinely
have no `config.json` at all; without this, `get()` re-issued the HTTP GET
for such a repo on every single call — a route this feeds is polled, so
that meant hammering the Hub, forever, for a repo that will never answer
differently. See `NEGATIVE_TTL_SECONDS`'s own docstring.

**Never raises into a route.** Every network or parse failure — DNS, timeout,
a non-200, a truncated or non-JSON body, a repo id `urllib.parse.quote` cannot
encode — is caught here and answered as "no metadata", the same contract
`mirror.fetch_json` and `footprints.read` already keep for their own callers.

#: weights: fetching this for every row a Hub search returns is cheap in a way
#: fetching even one weight file would not be.

#: 13 days — see the module docstring for why this specific figure, not a
#: shorter or longer one.
TTL_SECONDS = 13 * 24 * 60 * 60

#: How long a NEGATIVE result — `_fetch_raw` could not turn `repo_id` into
#: bytes, for ANY reason, and there was no prior successful reading to fall
#: back on — is trusted before the next call retries (code review, finding
#: C). Far shorter than `TTL_SECONDS`, and deliberately ONE ttl for every
#: failure reason rather than trying to tell "this repo genuinely has no
#: `config.json`" (a GGUF repo — durable, could stand a longer TTL) apart
#: from "the network is down right now" (transient, wants a short one):
#: distinguishing those would need `_fetch_raw` to surface the HTTP status
#: rather than collapsing every failure to `None`, a bigger seam change for
#: a distinction the caller does not need — either way, `get()` today has
#: nothing better to do than wait and retry.
#:
#: **Why this exists at all**: before it did, a fetch that came back empty
#: wrote NOTHING to the store, so a repo with no `config.json` (GGUF repos
#: routinely have none) was re-fetched on every single call — a polled
#: catalog route reached the Hub, `_TIMEOUT_S` seconds at a time, on every
#: poll, forever; offline, that made a request stall for up to
#: `_TIMEOUT_S` seconds per repo it asked about in one page load.
NEGATIVE_TTL_SECONDS = 60 * 60

#: A `config.json` is a few KB. Anything wildly larger than this is not one —
#: refusing to read past it is the same defence `mirror.py`'s
#: `MAX_MANIFEST_BYTES` states for the same reason: an oversized response is
#: not "a bigger version of the thing we asked for", it is evidence the URL
#: served something else.
MAX_BYTES = 1024 * 1024

#: One request round trip. Slow enough to allow for the Hub under load, short
#: enough that a hung read cannot stall the catalog/search route it feeds —
#: mirrors `mirror.MANIFEST_TIMEOUT_S`'s reasoning for the same kind of call.
_TIMEOUT_S = 8.0

#: How many repos' harvested metadata are kept — the same reasoning
#: `footprints.MAX_MODELS` gives: a row is a few dozen bytes, and the bound
#: exists so a machine that has searched thousands of repos over its lifetime
#: does not grow this file without limit.
MAX_REPOS = 500

VERSION = 1

_UNREACHABLE = (urllib.error.URLError, OSError, ValueError, TimeoutError)

#: The subset of `config.json` this module harvests, and the key each lands
#: under in the returned dict — SPEC AI-17's own list. `head_dim` is read
#: verbatim when present; `fit.py`'s KV-cache term derives it from
#: `hidden_size / num_attention_heads` when it is absent, not this module —
#: harvesting stays a straight read of what the Hub published, never a guess.

#: Hybrid/Mamba configs (Jamba, Zamba, Nemotron-H, ...) expose which layers
#: are real attention vs. a state-space/Mamba block under one of these keys.
#: A future `fit.py` KV-cache term needs this list to count only the
#: attention layers — a flat `num_hidden_layers` overcounts a hybrid model's
#: KV cache by however many Mamba layers it has, which carry no KV cache at
#: all. Harvested here even though nothing reads it yet, for the same reason
#: `bench_store.py`'s `VERSION` field exists ahead of its first migration:
#: cheaper to capture alongside the rest of this fetch than to add a second
#: harvest pass later.

    draws** (code review finding 1): `hw_detect.cached_hardware()` is a
    plain `storage.read_json` and the only function `fit.py`/`speed.py` may
    call, because `detect_hardware()`/`refresh_hardware()` are a slow
    subprocess probe that must never sit on a route the picker polls. This
    module's own `get()` is the equivalent slow path here — a synchronous
    `urllib` GET with an 8-second timeout — and until this function existed,
    `ai_runtime._accepts_image`/`_capability_tags` called `get()` directly
    from `describe_catalog`, which is exactly a route the picker polls. A
    `llamacpp-text` catalog (five curated GGUF repos, none of which
    publishes a `config.json`) turned one catalog request into up to five
    back-to-back 8-second-timeout fetches when offline or behind a captive
