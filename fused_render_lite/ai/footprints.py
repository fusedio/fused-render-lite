"""Measured resident footprints at ~/.fused-render/ai_footprints.json (SPEC
AI-16a, D497).

One more shell-state resource in the shape `bench_store.py` establishes: a
private `_path()` over `storage.home_dir()`, then `storage.read_json` /
`storage.write_json` and nothing else. It lives under `ai/` rather than
`shell/` for the same reason `bench_store.py` does — its readers are the AI
subsystem and its router.

**Why this file exists at all.** A model's PEAK resident footprint is already
measured, for free, on every load and every benchmark run — `supervisor.
refresh_memory` re-reads `/health` on every poll, and `AI-8c`'s
`peak_resident_bytes` is a true high-water mark whenever the runner supplies
one. Nothing kept it. `fit.py` (AI-16) needs a NUMBER, not a re-measurement —
the whole point of the "measured" rung on its precedence ladder is a machine
that has already run a model once knowing better than a curator's guess or a
download's byte count — so the number the app already has has to be written
down somewhere a later page load can read it back.

**Written by `supervisor.refresh_memory`**, never by this module's own
callers directly: a Worker only knows what it measured, and `refresh_memory`
is the one place that already re-reads every live worker's health on a
cadence the rest of the app relies on. A benchmark run (AI-14) is covered by
construction rather than by a second writer — `benchmark._memory_and_device`
reads the same `describe()` rows this file's writer already covers.

**Keyed by `<capability>/<model_id>`, not by repo.** Since AI-11j the same
checkpoint can serve two capabilities with two different footprints — an
mlx-vlm load that touches the vision tower is not the load that does not —
so a repo id alone would conflate two real, different numbers under one key.

**The MACHINE is recorded once, at the top of the file, and a mismatch
discards the file wholesale.** `benchmark.machine()` states the reason a
per-run copy of machine identity exists at all: "a home directory gets
restored onto a new laptop". Every number in this file was measured on the
machine recorded here — a machine identity mismatch means every number in
the file describes hardware this process is not running on, so there is
nothing to salvage and nothing to reconcile row-by-row. Compared on
`platform`/`arch`/`totalMemoryBytes` only — NOT `cpuCount`, which
`benchmark.machine()` also reports but which is not part of what "the same
machine" means here (a VM reconfigured with a different core count while
keeping the same RAM and architecture is still the same memory budget this
file is about).

A corrupt or absent file reads as no observations, never a raise — the exact
contract `storage.read_json` already gives, restated because `fit.py`'s own
degrading precedence ladder depends on "no measurement yet" being silent
rather than a 500 on the AI Models page.

**Bounded by construction**, the discipline `server/ai_metrics.py` and
`bench_store.py` both state: at most `MAX_MODELS` rows, oldest `observedAt`
dropped on insert. A high-water is only rewritten when it GROWS, past a small
tolerance — `_GROWTH_TOLERANCE` — so a resident figure jittering by a few
bytes across polls does not rewrite the file on every `/health` read.

#: `benchmark` is imported lazily, inside the functions that need `machine()`,

#: module (for `refresh_memory`'s write) — a top-level `import benchmark` here
#: would close that cycle at import time (`supervisor -> footprints ->

#: module rather than resolving. Deferred imports break the cycle without
#: changing what either module DOES.

#: How many <capability>/<model_id> rows are kept. A row is a few dozen
