"""What a model DOES, in Hugging Face's own vocabulary, and whether we run it.

**One table, keyed by the Hub's `pipeline_tag`.** This module replaces three
tables that used to sit apart — a tag-to-prose map in `hub_cache.py`, a
prose-to-capability map in `registry.py`, and a ruled-out list beside it — and
the split between them is what let two bugs through:

* **The vocabulary was OPEN.** The tag-to-prose step ended in
  `tag.replace("-", " ")`, so any string the Hub invented became a task label
  nobody had classified. `SymphonyGen/SymphonyGen` (`pipeline_tag:
  reinforcement-learning`, four `.pt` files, no `config.json`) came out as a
  label in neither table, fell through the format fallback, and was offered in
  the Playground's TEXT section with a Load button aimed at mlx-lm.
* **"Ruled out" and "never heard of" were the SAME answer** — both `None` — so
  no caller could tell a task we have decided not to serve from one nobody has
  looked at. `classify()` returns three states instead, and that distinction is
  what stops a ruled-out task from being rescued by a format guess.

The tag list is **vendored from `@huggingface/tasks`** (huggingface.js,
`packages/tasks/src/pipelines.ts`, `PIPELINE_DATA`) — the same table that routes
the Hub's own inference widgets, and the only authoritative enumeration of the
vocabulary; no Python package ships it. Vendored rather than fetched because
classification runs OFFLINE: `hub_cache.cached_capability` reads a snapshot
directory and makes no network call, and a page that needed the Hub to say what
a downloaded model is would stop working on a plane. A tag we have not vendored
is not an error — it is `UNKNOWN`, which is a state with its own behaviour (see
below) rather than a fallback into somebody's capability.

`tests/test_ai_tasks.py` pins that every vendored tag is classified, and
`scripts/` has no generator: the list is small, changes a few times a year, and
a hand-maintained table is reviewable in a way a generated one is not.

    `catalog.py` recommends. Their own `tags` say `text-to-image` (or
    `image-generation`, per `_TAG_ALIASES`), which is the claim the app can
    act on, and their community quants — which put `text-to-image` in the
    slot — were surviving the same query all along. A search that shows
    fifteen conversions of a model but not the model is answering a question
    nobody asked.

    **Why this cannot rescue a ruled-out repo into a lie.** The fallback only
    lands on a tag `supported_tags()` already contains, so the capability it
    produces is one some runner declares — never a format guess, never a new
    capability, and never through `UNKNOWN`'s open vocabulary (see
    `classify`). A repo that genuinely only does the unsupported job does not
    claim the supported one: checked against the Hub's own answers for
    `esrgan`, where this rescues nothing at all, because a real upscaler says
    `image-to-image` and stops. What it does admit at the margin is the
    occasional controlnet or edit LoRA whose card claims `text-to-image` —
    the author's own claim, which is exactly what `pipeline_tag` is too, and
    this tab already lists LoRAs.

    **The primary slot still wins whenever it says anything we serve**, so
    this is purely additive: a repo `classify` already supported is
    classified identically, and only a null capability reaches the `tags`
    pass. A repo whose tags say nothing keeps `classify`'s own answer —
    `NO_RUNNER` or `UNKNOWN`, reason intact — because that answer is still
    the most precise thing known about it.

    Scanned in `supported_tags()` order rather than the repo's own tag order:
    the Hub does not promise a stable order within `tags`, and a classifier
    whose answer depended on it would be unreproducible for one repo. The
    order used instead is the menu's (text, then multimodal, then vision,
    then audio), so a repo claiming two supported tasks resolves the same way
    every time — and to the one a person scanning the filter menu meets first.
