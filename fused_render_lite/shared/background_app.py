"""A background daemon's client for the background-apps API, about ITSELF
(SPEC.md §46 / D505).

Every endpoint under `/api/apps/background/*` (`server/routers/background_apps.py`)
keys off `html` — the page's own path — and resolves the app folder from it
server-side (`_folder_for` there does `os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(html))`).
A background daemon spawned by `engine_host.ensure_background` has no page and
no `html` path of its own, so this module gives it a way to ask the server
about itself: check whether it is still enabled, tell the server to stop it,
or turn itself off.

The missing piece is `FUSED_RENDER_APP_DIR` — exported into a background
child's environment only (`engine_host.py`'s `_spawn_env`, keyed on
`Child.folder`) — the app folder the daemon's own manifest declared. This
module reads that var, synthesizes a stand-in `html` path inside the folder
(the server only ever takes its `dirname`, so the leaf name is arbitrary —
`"index.html"` is used because that is what a real page would be called), and
speaks the same endpoints a page's `fused.daemon.*` calls speak.

Run state and autostart are independent (D511): `stop()` only kills this
process, `set_autostart(bool)` only flips the persisted flag — neither
implies the other.

**Stdlib only, no `import fused_render`** — same constraint as `fused_ai.py`
and `appenv.py` beside this file (see the `adding-a-shared-template-utility`
skill): a background daemon runs in its own project's venv with `PYTHONPATH`
stripped, and can be this app's own `sys.executable` too, but must never
depend on the package being importable either way.

**Origin resolution mirrors `fused_ai.resolve_origin` exactly** (not
reinvented): `appenv.origin()` first (set for every process the server
spawned — a background daemon always qualifies), else a connect-probed
`server.json` under the shell home dir, else `ServerNotRunning`. Kept as a
second small copy rather than importing `fused_ai.py` itself: that module
pulls in the whole AI job-polling surface (`_IMAGE_WIRE_KEYS` and friends)
for a caller that wants three tiny endpoints, and this file's whole point is
to be safely vendorable on its own, the same as `fused_ai.py` is.
