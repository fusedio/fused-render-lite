"""How a template learns about the app it is running inside — via the ENV.

SPEC PY-15 / DECISIONS D166.

This module is the supported contract between the server and a template: the
server exports a handful of `FUSED_RENDER_*` variables before it starts serving
(`server.export_app_env`, plus `shell.mounts.export_ro_mounts_env` for the
read-only list), every child process inherits them, and the helpers here are the
one place that knows how to read them.

Templates must NOT import `fused_render`. They used to reach into the app for
exactly these facts (`from fused_render.shell.mounts import mounts_dir, ...`,
behind a try/except), which works only when the template happens to run as a
child of a Python that can see the package. Under the fused local execution
backend it cannot: `PYTHONPATH` is stripped from child processes, the guarded
import silently takes its fallback branch, and a mount-backed path is quietly
treated as local. Environment variables survive that boundary, so the facts
travel as data instead of as an import.

Stdlib only, for the same reason — a template must stay runnable as a standalone
copy of its folder, with nothing but `../shared/` beside it.

Everything is resolved PER CALL from `os.environ`, never cached at import time:
some templates are long-lived daemons (`zarr_aoi/tile_server.py`) and the
read-only mount list changes underneath them as mounts attach and detach.

The store schema stays behind in `shell/mounts.py` — nothing here reads
`mounts.json`. A template gets the *derived answers* (which dirs, which
mountpoints are read-only), so the on-disk format can change freely without
breaking any template.

    sanitizing. Duplicating those rules here is how the two copies drift.

    shipped in this wheel but cloned at runtime from the public `fusedio/skills`
    repo into a directory the app owns under `home_dir()`

    build while the server kept its clones in `~/.fused-render/canvases`. The
