"""The background-job registry — the model behind the shell's download manager.

A page can start work that outlives the call that started it: a model download,
a checkpoint pull, a venv build, a generation that runs for minutes. Today each
one of those invents its own progress UI inside its own page, so the work is
only visible while you are looking straight at it — navigate away and an 8GB
download is happening with nothing on screen to say so. This module is the
shared place to say it: one record per long-running operation, held by the
server, shown by ONE surface in the shell (the download manager at the foot of
the notification stack).

**Why the server holds it, not the page.** The reporter and the viewer are
different documents. A rendered page lives in a same-origin iframe that the
shell tears down on every navigation, and it may not even be the same browser
tab as the shell chrome. The record has to outlive the reporter's document, so
it lives in the one process both sides can reach — and the same registry then
answers a detached Python worker POSTing to `/api/jobs` directly, with no
second mechanism.

In memory, deliberately: the jobs describe work happening in THIS app session,
and a restart of the server is the end of that session. Nothing here is
history — the call log (`calls.py`) is the durable record; this is the live one.

**Reporting is best-effort and never authoritative.** A reporter can die
mid-download (its page was closed) and the work carries on with nobody to
describe it. A record whose `state` is still "running" but which has not been
updated in `STALE_AFTER_S` is reported as `stalled`, which the UI shows as
exactly what it is — "no longer reporting" — rather than as a frozen bar that
looks like a hang. It is dropped entirely after `STALE_DROP_S` so a dead
reporter cannot wedge the list for the rest of the session.

No import of anything under `fused_render_lite.server` — the router imports this
module; keep it acyclic.

# The state machine. "running" and "waiting" are the two NON-terminal
# states; the three terminal ones differ in what the user has to do about
# them, which is what decides how long each is kept (see `_sweep`).
#
# `WAITING`: work has stopped and is not coming back on its own — it is
# sitting on a QUESTION only the user can answer (today, the sole producer is
# `envinstall._mirror_into_jobs`'s `needs_build` branch: uv's "Install
# anyway" compile prompt). Not `RUNNING` — nothing is actually in flight, so
# a bar or a spinner would be a lie. Not `TERMINAL` either, and deliberately
# so: none of the three terminal states means "stopped, waiting on you" —
# `done` and `cancelled` both read as the row having reached an end the user
# does not need to act on, and `error` reads as "broken", which is worse than
# wrong here, since the compile prompt this row is sitting in front of is
# still an open, answerable question, not a failure. Kept OUT of
# `TERMINAL_STATES` on purpose: `upsert`'s finished-transition bookkeeping
# (`finished_at`, clearing `cancel_requested`) does not apply to a row that
# has not actually finished, and `_sweep`'s age-out clock must not start
# either — see `_sweep`'s own comment for how it is kept instead.

# The four notification tiers a producer picks for its own row (SPEC

# (frontend/src/platform/lib/jobs.ts `popupJobs`) — every other tier still
# pops on its way to terminal, `transient` included; what a non-silent tier
# decides is what happens AFTER that pop:
#   "attention"  — kept in the panel until dismissed, and drawn there
#                  without the panel having to be opened.
#   "trail"      — kept in the panel until dismissed.
#   "transient"  — kept nowhere; its card is the only trace it leaves.
#   "silent"     — kept nowhere AND pops nothing: a producer declares this
#                  when finishing is not news (a resident model load/unload,
#                  say — the running row was already visible, and turning
#                  "done" says nothing new). Silence is a property of
#                  SUCCESS only: `effective_tier`/`effectiveTier` still
#                  promotes an `error`/`cancelled` row to "attention"
#                  regardless of the declared tier, so a silent job that
#                  fails is always news and still pops and sticks around.

# exactly like every row did before this field existed.

TOTAL_SCOPES = ("download", "phase")

# How long a finished job stays on screen ONCE SOMEONE HAS READ IT — the
# retention clock starts at first READ (`Job.first_read_at`), not at
# completion. The corner is meant to answer "is my work done", not to be read
# as a log — once a `done`/`cancelled` row has had a moment to register, it
# should clear itself so the manager stays a picture of what is happening NOW,
# not an accumulating list of what already happened. The client
# (`pollInterval` in jobs.ts) holds a matching grace window on ACTIVE-cadence
# polling after the last running job disappears, so the row is swept close to
# on-schedule instead of lagging behind a slow poll.
#
# **Why read-gated rather than a flat clock from `finished_at`.** A job that
# starts AND finishes entirely server-side — a scheduled run, or a Python
# reporter POSTing straight to `/api/jobs` with no `fused.trackJob()` handle —
# runs no JS, so it never calls `pingJobs()`, the only thing that nudges the
# shell's poll out of its idle cadence (jobs.ts `POLL_IDLE_MS`, 5s). A flat
# `finished_at + FINISHED_TTL_S` clock could then expire the row entirely
# between two idle polls: anything under roughly `POLL_IDLE_MS` of work could
# be born and swept with NOBODY ever having seen it, which is precisely the
# guarantee this constant exists to give ("noticed by someone who was not
# watching the corner", SPEC BG-6). Gating the clock on the first successful
# `list_jobs()` read — the same call the dock's poll and `fused.watchJob` both
# make — guarantees every reader gets a real `FINISHED_TTL_S` window from the
# moment THEY could first have seen the row, at the cost of an unread row
# living arbitrarily long (bounded by `FINISHED_UNREAD_DROP_S` below, not by
# this constant).
#
# **Known limitation, accepted rather than solved:** the clock starts on the
# FIRST read by ANY client, not per-client — so a second, slower reader (a
# background tab, a client that only polls occasionally) can still open the
# dock after the fast reader's `FINISHED_TTL_S` has elapsed and find the row
# already gone. Per-client retention would need a per-client read log, which
# is a much larger feature for a case this rare; "seen by the first reader
# to look" is the guarantee actually being made.
#
# Two rejected alternatives (see DECISIONS.md D469): a shorter fixed TTL from
# `finished_at` (does not fix the "never read at all" case, only shrinks its
# window) and dropping `POLL_IDLE_MS` to ~2s (a permanent background request
# every 2s for the life of every session, to cover a rare case a read gate
# covers for free).
#
# An `error` is exempt: it is the one outcome the user may need to act on, so
# it stays until dismissed — the same rule the persistent-error toast follows
# (lib/toast's ttlMs=0). MAX_JOBS is what bounds it.

# whose dock never polls again. Without this, such a row would sit in

# once something reads the row, so an unread row is otherwise unbounded, and
# `MAX_JOBS` is a DIFFERENT rule (capacity pressure, not "this work is over"
# — see `_sweep`'s docstring) that only bites once 64 rows have piled up.
# Same magnitude as `STALE_DROP_S` below and for the same reason: ten minutes
# is long enough that any UI actually watching the corner would have read the

# **Not a hard cap any more, and deliberately so.** A queue of transcriptions
# (SPEC AI-10a) makes "more than 64 rows of live work" the designed usage, and

    raised from a user's own app page used to be captioned "Playground"
    regardless, because the producer had no way to name the real caller).

    *page* is whatever the caller already has for `X-Fused-Page` — same
    string `Job.page` is built from, just not persisted as one, since a
    report can change `origin` on a tick that carries no `page` at all
    (`upsert`'s `origin=` argument is applied independently of `page=`).

    - A KNOWN SHELL ROUTE (`_ORIGIN_BY_ROUTE`) names its own label — these
      are the shell's own SPA surfaces, which already have real names a page
      can't be asked to guess.
    - Anything else truthy is an fs path — the overwhelming majority of real
      `X-Fused-Page` values, one of the user's own app pages. Named after the
      PROJECT the file belongs to, the same pair (`projectenv.project_root_for`
      + `projectenv.display_name`) a runner's own venv-build row already

      outside any project this process recognizes (nothing under the

      test, and a real possibility for a one-off script) falls back to the
      bare filename with its extension dropped, the next best thing to a
      project name when there is no project.
    - A non-absolute (or otherwise malformed) *page* is refused BEFORE the
      project lookup, not treated as an fs path at all:
      `projectenv.project_root_for` starts with `os.path.abspath(path)`, so
      a relative or garbled `X-Fused-Page` (a typo, never a real page) would
      resolve against THIS SERVER's own cwd and caption the row after
      whatever project happens to contain it — a project the page has
      nothing to do with. `default` here too, same as the empty-page case:
      there is nothing honest to derive from a value that was never a real
      path.
    - EMPTY means no page raised this report at all — the one caller-named
      case this function cannot answer on its own, since it is *default*
      that carries the honest answer: only a shell surface running with no
      iframe of its own (the AI Models Playground, Claude Code's own
      settings page) sends no `X-Fused-Page`, and each such producer already
      knows which surface it is.

    Upsert rather than create+update: a reporter's every progress tick is the

    server-side record (an app restart mid-download) transparently re-creates
    it instead of failing every tick from then on.

    Only the keys PRESENT in the body are applied — a tick that carries just
    `done` must not blank the title the first tick set. That is also why this
    reads the body directly instead of taking a fully-populated Job.

    `server=True` is for THIS process reporting its own work (a model download,
    a generation), and it is the only way to write a `sys:` id. The HTTP
    endpoint never passes it, so a page cannot post progress for a job the
    server owns — those ids are deterministic, and a forged "done" on a download
    still running is exactly the lie the manager would have no way to catch.

    `origin=`, like `page=`, is threaded in as its own argument rather than
    trusted from the body — a page could otherwise attribute its own row to
    "Claude setup" or "Scheduler" by typing one of those strings into its
    report, and the whole point of the field is that the caption can be
    trusted. The HTTP endpoint computes it server-side, from the report's own
    `X-Fused-Page` (`origin_for_page`), and passes the verdict in here; a
    truthy value always wins, on every tick, the same way a truthy `page=`

    `is_stalled` only means "no report in `STALE_AFTER_S`" (30s); a job can be
    genuinely `RUNNING` and merely quiet for that long — a slow model load, a
    generation between report ticks, a throttled background tab — and the

    oversight to fix later.** This function is not only the shell's `GET
    /api/jobs` — `grep -rn "list_jobs(" fused_render_lite/` also finds
    `supervisor._cancel_state` (polled every `_CANCEL_CHECK_INTERVAL_S`,
    0.5s, for the whole duration of every model load) and
    `capture._cancel_requested` (an internal cancel poll of its own), neither
    of which is a person looking at the corner. If this function marked rows
    read by default, a scheduled run finishing while any model happened to be
    loading would get `first_read_at` stamped by the supervisor's own poll
    within half a second, with no browser anywhere — the row would sweep
    `FINISHED_TTL_S` later with nobody having seen it, which is exactly the
    failure the read gate exists to prevent, reached through a different

    **The asymmetry that decides the default:** a row that never gets marked
    lingers for up to `FINISHED_UNREAD_DROP_S` (10 minutes) before the

    by a caller that was never actually looking loses the outcome entirely

    it there would restart the exact bug FINISHED_TTL_S's read-gating
    exists to fix: the retention clock ticking down from the moment of
    completion again, just relabelled.

    **Order matters**: `_sweep` runs FIRST, against whatever `first_read_at`
    values already existed from an EARLIER call, and only THEN does this
    function (when `mark_read`) mark newly-terminal rows as read for THIS
    call. A row can therefore never be swept in the same call that first
    reveals it — the sweep that could act on today's read already ran before

    that list *is* meant to hold a log — a `done` row expiring 3s after its
    first read was deleting the very entry Notifications exists to keep, out
    from under a user who had not yet looked. THE FIX: `done` and
    `cancelled` get the same unconditional exemption `error`/`WAITING`
    already had. `MAX_JOBS`'s cap (below) is what bounds all of them now.

    **Two families of terminal row do NOT get this exemption, for two
    different reasons, and this branch must not conflate them:**

    - **A `sys:schedule:*` row (`SCHEDULE_JOB_PREFIX`) ages out in ANY
      terminal state — `done`, `error`, or `cancelled` alike.** The reason
      is that nothing ever draws it: `jobRows` in
      `frontend/src/platform/lib/jobs.ts` excludes this id prefix
      unconditionally, and `ActivityDock.tsx`'s own header comment records
      that exclusion as deliberate (D661) — the row is invisible on every
      surface regardless of what state it ends in or what tier it declares.
      A scheduled run already has its own row on the Scheduled page, and a
      missed or failed one also gets a toast
      (`platform/lib/schedule-toast.ts`'s `toastForEvent`, `null` for a
      successful run); the registry row here is a copy nobody can see or
      dismiss, so it ages out on the ORIGINAL read-gated `FINISHED_TTL_S`
      clock every terminal row had before D663, unconditionally on id alone
      — not on tier, not on outcome.

    - **Every other row whose STORED `job.tier` is `TRANSIENT` OR `SILENT`
      ages out only once its state is `done`.** Every producer besides the
      scheduler IS drawn somewhere the moment it lands in a non-silent
      terminal state — a resident model load and an index scan surface in
      Notifications (`terminalNotifications`), a text/image/video
      generation surfaces in Activity while running and, on a failure, in
      Notifications too — so a failed transient/silent row is not an orphan
      the way a scheduled tick is: it is a row someone can see, with a
      working ✕, describing exactly why their request did not come back
      with what they asked for (a `SILENT` producer's own failure is
      promoted to `attention` by `effective_tier` well before it ever
      reaches this branch — see below — so the only `SILENT` rows this
      branch ever sees in a terminal state are `done` ones). Ageing that out
      on the same read-gated clock a `done` row uses would forget a
      resident model's failed load, a failed index scan, or a failed text
      generation a few seconds after the next poll stamps `first_read_at` —
      the vanishing-row bug D663 already settled against, reintroduced under
      a different gate. A `TRANSIENT`/`SILENT` producer only earns age-out
      on SUCCESS, because success is what leaves nothing behind to look at;
      a failure is attention, and stays until an explicit dismiss like any
      other row a surface can show.

    Both halves read the STORED `job.tier`/id, never `effective_tier` —
    retention and visibility are different questions. Visibility asks "what
    does this row mean right now" (`effectiveTier`/`effective_tier`'s
    error/cancelled override, read by `jobRows` and `terminalNotifications`
    in the frontend). Retention asks "does ANY surface draw this row at
    all, and if so, did its run actually finish with nothing left to show."
    Reading `effective_tier` here instead would turn every failed/cancelled
    transient row into `attention` and fall it through to the
    keep-until-dismissed branch below regardless of which of the two
    families it belongs to — right by accident for the schedule family (it
    is never drawn, so nothing would ever dismiss it, and it would sit
    forever) and wrong for every other transient producer (whose failure
    the read-gated clock would then silently forget instead of holding for
    the ✕ that can actually reach it).

    `FINISHED_TTL_S`/`FINISHED_UNREAD_DROP_S`/`job.first_read_at` are left in
    place rather than deleted for this reason — `list_jobs`'s `mark_read`
    still has other callers (`routers/jobs.py`, `supervisor.py`,
    `capture/__init__.py`) whose own read-vs-poll distinction does not
    depend on this branch, and a genuinely transient row on either family
    is exactly the one reachable state that still exercises this read-gated
    clock.

    **`WAITING` is exempt from the cap below (`evictable`), not only from
    ageing out here.** Its reporter has already exited (the sole producer,
    `envinstall._mirror_into_jobs`'s "Install anyway" prompt, has nothing
    left polling), so `updated_at` never advances — under the cap's own sort
    key, `(state == RUNNING, updated_at)`, a long-open `WAITING` row becomes
    the single least-recently-updated evictable row and would be the FIRST
    thing dropped once the registry fills, exactly the outcome this
    exemption exists to prevent. See the cap's own comment for the rest of
    the reasoning it shares with live `SERVER` rows.
