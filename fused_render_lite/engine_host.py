"""Managed daemons, owned by this server (fused.daemon). Copied from
fused-render's `server/engine_host.py` minus the template path (`ensure`,
`_validate`, reinit replay stays as a no-op registry) — lite only has
background apps: a .fused app's own `daemon =` or the shipped `main =`
worker (`engine_worker.py`).

Each engine_id names one child: it binds :0 and publishes {port, token, pid,
version} to a status file — binding in the child and reporting back is the
only version with no race — and the host keeps the Popen so it can reap via
poll() (never os.kill(pid, 0), which kills the process on Windows), replace a
wedged child, and kill the whole tree on quit. The browser never sees the
port or token: `engine_forward.py` proxies everything through the stable
server origin under `/api/engines/<id>/proxy/...`.

**macOS spawns via posix_spawn, never fork()** — the same hazard
`ai/supervisor._spawn_kwargs` documents (a parent with PROJ/SQLite atfork
handlers resident segfaults every forked child before exec). CPython takes
posix_spawn only with no `cwd`, `close_fds=False` and no
`start_new_session`, so on darwin the child is launched through a tiny
`-c` bootstrap that does `os.setsid()` + `chdir` itself before running the
daemon file as `__main__` — so `_kill_tree`'s `killpg` and the daemon's
relative paths behave exactly as fused-render's `cwd=` + `start_new_session`
shape did. Linux/Windows keep that shape verbatim.

    the trust boundary either — it is a check that the caller did not hand
    over a daemon belonging to some folder whose OWN manifest does not
    declare it.

    Deliberately independent of the autostart store (D511): autostart is a
    separate, opt-in flag, and `start()` must work whether or not it is set,
    so this asks the declaring folder for ITS manifest
    (`background_apps.load_manifest`, self-contained — no store lookup) and
    checks simply "does that folder's manifest declare exactly this daemon
    file", which needs nothing but the daemon path itself.

    `folder` is the caller's own resolved declaring folder — the same one
    `ensure_background` threads onto `Child.folder` — used here instead of
    `os.path.dirname(daemon)` (D513): `load_manifest` only enforces
    containment, not flatness, so a manifest's `daemon` naming a NESTED path
    (`daemon = "src/daemon.py"`) is legal, and `dirname(daemon)` for such an
    app is a subfolder with no `pyproject.toml` of its own — re-deriving the
    folder that way made every such app un-startable (see `Child.folder`'s
    docstring, which already called this hazard out). Falls back to
    `os.path.dirname(daemon)` when `folder` is empty, preserving today's
    behavior for flat layouts and for the few direct callers (tests only —
    every production call site passes `folder`) that still don't pass one.

    A `main =` manifest never sets `manifest.daemon` — it is served by
    `DEFAULT_DAEMON`, which lives in this package, outside every app folder,
    so the folder-containment check above cannot apply to it. This is the
    one narrow exemption (mirroring `_validate`'s own templates-root
    allowlist): `daemon` is accepted here ONLY when it resolves to the exact

    in scope, the same way it already has `cache`/`version`) — stored on the
    `Child` so `_spawn_env` can export `FUSED_RENDER_APP_DIR` to the daemon,
    and passed to `_validate_background` so it validates `daemon` against the
    manifest of the folder that actually declared it, not a re-derived one
    (D513 — re-deriving via `os.path.dirname(daemon)` breaks any manifest
    whose `daemon` names a nested path). Optional (defaults to `""`) only so
    existing direct callers that don't care about it need not pass one; every
    production call site does. The reuse check below is `_matches` alone,
    same as `ensure`'s own — a background app's engine_id and a template's
    are drawn from disjoint namespaces (`background_apps.engine_id_for`'s
    `bg_`-prefixed digest vs. a template's bare name), and `_matches` already
    compares `daemon`, so a same-id-different-protocol collision could not
    pass it anyway.

    `idle_timeout_s` is the manifest's own policy, threaded onto `Child`
    unchanged; a non-zero value starts the idle sweeper (see
    `_ensure_reaper`) so this child actually gets reaped. `module` is set
    only for a `main =` manifest (`daemon` is then `DEFAULT_DAEMON`), telling
    `_spawn` which file to pass as `--module`. `retry_post` is the manifest's
    own `retry_post` (`background_apps.Manifest.retry_post`), threaded onto
    `Child` unchanged."""

    Modelled on `background_running_folders` above, and for the same reasons:
    the list is taken UNDER `_lock` and `_alive()` is called OUTSIDE it, so a
    `Popen.poll()` per child never happens while the lock is held. Everything
    is already in memory, so this is a dict snapshot plus one poll per child —
    no folder walk, no toml read.

    A helper HERE rather than the router reaching into `_children`: the router
    must not touch this module's lock or its private dict (the same boundary
    `background_running_folders` exists to keep).

    `folder` and `module` are reported as-is — `folder` is set for a
    background child only, and `module` for a `main =` daemon (a `daemon =`
    app leaves it empty), so the caller can label a row without having to
    guess the manifest's protocol.

    UPTIME AND IDLE_FOR ANSWER "WHY IS THIS STILL HERE, AND FOR HOW LONG"
    (user call: a daemon row that says only its name leaves the panel
    unreadable — "if a daemon has a timeout, lets also mention that"). Both
    are derived from the same `now`, so one row cannot report an uptime and
    a countdown taken a poll apart:

    * `uptime_s` — seconds since this child's bring-up began.
    * `idle_timeout_s` — the manifest's own policy, `0` for a resident child
      (`daemon =`, and every template daemon), which the caller renders as
      "no idle timeout" rather than as "retires in 0s".
    * `idle_for_s` — seconds since the last call was routed here. Reported
      for every child, but only meaningful against a non-zero timeout.
    * `busy` — idle-retire is currently skipping this child, so a stalled-
      looking countdown has an explanation rather than reading as a bug.

    `busy` is not simply `_busy`'s own gate: a call that outran the 60s proxy
    budget gets a 504, whose `finally` calls `mark_idle` (engine_forward.py / server.py)
    — `_busy` drops to 0 and `last_used` is stamped as though the call had
    ended, but the worker's `main()` keeps running. `reap_idle_children`
    knows this and consults `_inflight` (a ping to the worker) before
    reaping; a row that only echoed `_busy` would read "retiring now" for
    exactly the state this field exists to explain. So a child past its own
    idle timeout with `_busy` already clear is pinged the same way
    `reap_idle_children` pings it — rare by construction, since only a
    reap CANDIDATE is ever pinged — before its `busy` is decided.

    `_busy` is snapshotted under the same `_lock` hold as `_children` so the
    two cannot disagree about a child, and `_alive()`/`_inflight()` still run
    outside it.

    Exposed so a test can drive it directly.

    The Child record is left in `_children` (dead, but present) rather than
    popped: `engine_forward._forward`'s existing heal-on-proxy path calls
    `restart(engine_id, child)` using an existing record's own bring-up args
    whenever a proxied call finds it unreachable, and only 409s when
    `current(engine_id)` is `None` from the start. Popping the record here
    would defeat that path for every retired `main =` child, since the very
    next call to it would find no record at all instead of one `restart` can
    revive — the same reason autostart folders (no page ever calling here)
    still need the next call to re-warm them. `stop()` still fully clears the
    record: that IS the "quit this app right now, stay down" contract a
    `daemon =` app's explicit stop makes, which idle retirement (an invisible,

    Candidate selection also requires `_alive(c)`: a record left behind by an
    earlier sweep (or by `stop()`'s sibling paths) still carries its stale
    `last_used`, so without this check every later sweep would re-match the
    same already-dead child, re-log its retirement, and re-signal a pid the
    OS may since have recycled. `_alive` is a local `Popen.poll()`, not I/O,
