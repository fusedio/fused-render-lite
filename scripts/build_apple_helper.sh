# OUT defaults to fused_render_app/ai/apple/bin/fused-apple-ai — the checkout
# location `fused_render/ai/apple/host.py` looks in (gitignored). build_dmg.sh
# and the `apple-helper` CI job pass their own OUT.
#
# Needs a full Xcode 26 (the FoundationModels and Speech frameworks live in the
# macOS 26 SDK; Command Line Tools alone do not ship them). Fails loudly when
# the selected toolchain is older, naming the fix, so a CI runner on the wrong
# image cannot produce a silently broken helper.
