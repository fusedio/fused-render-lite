/**
 * Apps that are EMBEDDED SURFACES rather than routes: another app hosts them as
 * a pane, the way the shell hosts a route. `apps/claude` is the only one — the
 * Claude chat is framed by the explorer's sidebar, its folder listing pane, its
 * content pane and the canvases workspace, and every one of those is an app.
 *
 * Not lifted into `platform/` instead, which was the alternative: platform may
 * not import apps either (the rule above), so a `platform/ui/ChatMount.tsx`
 * re-export would need this same exception pointing the other way — and it would
 * put a 20-file subsystem with its own protocol, panes and styles in the layer
 * that is meant to hold the pieces every app shares.
 *
 * A shared app is still an APP: it imports platform and itself and nothing else,
 * which the loop below enforces by EXCLUDING a shared app from the shared-app
 * allowance — so `apps/explorer → apps/claude` passes while `apps/claude →`
 * any other app does not, whatever else SHARED_APPS grows to hold.

const SHARED_APPS = new Set(["apps/claude"]);

/**
 * SHELL MODULES AN APP MAY IMPORT — the one hole in "an app never imports
 * shell", and it is a hole with exactly one module in it.
 *
 * The rule's usual answer is the one `shell/EraseTaskModal.tsx` records: when an
 * app needs a shell component, the component moves DOWN to `platform/` and the
 * shell keeps a one-line re-export. That works when the component's own
 * dependencies are already platform-only, which the erase dialog's were.
 *
 * `shell/ScheduleTaskViews.tsx` is the case where it does not. Its row is built
 * on `shell/tasks-lib.ts` — the several thousand lines that decide what a task's
 * status ring, title line, time cell, file mark, schedule mark and unread count
 * ARE — and lifting the row means lifting that, `shell/schedule-lib.ts` under it,
 * and the Board and calendar that also read them. That is a move worth making on
 * its own merits and not as a side effect of a list swapping its row component
 * (.claude-design/design.md §B, "Risks": "if separate, lift TaskList + TaskNode
 * to platform/").
 *
 * So the chat's Recent list imports the Tasks page's row rather than copying it,
 * because the alternative is the drift this whole page's vocabulary is written
 * against: two rows that must look and read identically, maintained apart.
 *
 * `shell/tasks-lib.ts` is in the set for the same reason and no further one: the
 * chat's Recent list must be ordered by `sortForList`, the Tasks list view's own
 * sort (Akshil, 2026-09-14), and a copy of that order in the chat is the exact
 * drift this set was opened for. It is a pure module — no React, no shell
 * component — so nothing else comes with it.
 *
 * `shell/TaskPeekWho.tsx` is the third: the chat's in-session header IS the task
 * side peek's identity block (ring · TASK-nnn · title · project), so the two are
 * one component rather than two that must be kept looking alike. It was split
 * out of `shell/TaskPeek.tsx` precisely so the chat does not import the peek
 * itself — which hosts `@apps/claude` and would close a cycle.
 *
 * BY MODULE, not by layer: `apps/claude` may import THESE files and nothing else
 * out of shell, so the hole cannot quietly widen into "apps import shell".
 */
/*
 * `shell/tasksPulse` is the fourth, and it is a TRANSPORT rather than a view:
 * the one `GET /api/tasks` + `/api/tasks/changes` long-poll this document is
 * allowed to run (2026-09-15). It lives in shell because it imports
 * `shell/tasks-lib` — the pulse summary, the seen map and `mergeTaskChanges`
 * are all that module's — so it cannot move down to `platform/lib` without
 * dragging the whole task model with it. The chat subscribes because the
 * alternative is the bug this hole was opened to close: every ClaudeChat mount
 * opening its own long-poll, twelve cards on the Tasks wall exhausting the
 * browser's six-socket budget, and the page's boot reads queueing behind them.
