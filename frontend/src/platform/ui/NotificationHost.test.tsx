// The job pop-up's IDENTITY as `NotificationHost` mounts it — not its own
// internal countdown, which `JobPopupCard.test.tsx` already covers in full.
//
// `jobs.ts`'s `popupTick` keys "have I popped this?" on `popupKey` (id +
// `finished_at`), not on the bare id, precisely because one id CAN go
// terminal more than once: `fused_render/ai/supervisor.py`'s
// `job_id_for(model)` mints one id per resident model (`sys:ai-model:*`),
// reused across that model's load, weights-only download and unload, not a
// fresh id per run the way `jobs.py`'s ordinary job ids are. If the mounted
// `<JobPopupCard>` is keyed only on `job.id`, a second terminal event landing
// on the same id while the first card is still up (or leaving) reuses that
// same component instance — its mount effect (`[]` deps) already ran once
// for the first event and never reruns, so the second event's card never
// restarts its own countdown and can vanish on the FIRST event's timer
// instead of running its own `JOB_POPUP_VISIBLE_MS` in full.
