// App Doctor: the share-readiness checklist for one app folder, grouped into
// sections and, within each section, ordered worst-first (appdoctor-lib.ts's
// `sortByAttention`) so a failing row never has to be scrolled to. Each
// failing row carries its own severity and its own fix action.
//
// It is the app page's "App Doctor" TAB (shell/AppPage.tsx, `AppDoctorPanel`
// below, mounted as `?_tab=doctor`) and a DIALOG in the explorer's entry-page
// topbar (`AppDoctorModal`, apps/explorer/EntryActionsMenu.tsx). Both are the
// same three parts — `useAppDoctorReport`, `AppDoctorChecklist`,
// `AppDoctorFixAllButton` — in a different chassis; and it subsumes the "Migrate to new version" action: the stale
// `fused-api-version` tag is ONE ROW of the checklist rather than a button of
// its own, because it is never the only thing wrong with an app about to be
// shared — a pasted key, a path that only resolves on the author's machine, a
// `__pycache__` swept along and an uncommitted working tree are all invisible
// from the outside and all worth knowing before you send someone a folder.
//
// EVERY ROW BUT ONE IS DETERMINISTIC (fused_render/app_doctor.py, which is
// the authority on what each check means): a row passed, failed, or could not
// run, answered afresh on every GET. The exception is an ON-DEMAND row
// (`check.ondemand`, today `cross-browser`, fused_render/app_doctor_ai.py): a
// Sonnet read of the view files that spends tokens, so it runs only when its
// own Check button is pressed (`useAppDoctorReport`'s `runCheck`) — and it
// runs as a TASK on the app's entry page (`check.check_task` while live: the
// Tasks tab lists it, the shell's finished-task notice fires for it), never
// as a call this component waits on, so a tab switch cannot lose it. Its
// verdict is cached server-side on a checksum of those files — a GET draws
// the cached verdict for free, and reads `unrun` ("Not run yet") once the app
// has changed under it. A settled on-demand row keeps a Re-check for the
// case the cache cannot see: the rubric itself moved on.
// A FAILING row is not all the same kind of finding, though — `kind: "fact"`
// (a file exists or it does not) is a settled failure with a Fix button;
// `kind: "candidate"` (`secrets`, `device-paths`: a pattern match that only
// LOCATES something to look at, never decides — see app_doctor.py's own
// measurement) reads as "N to review" with a Review button, and never counts
// toward the header dot above warning on its own (appdoctor-lib.ts's
// `effectiveSeverity`). Judging a candidate is the fix session's job, which is
// why its button says Review rather than Fix.
//
// A FAILING row's SEVERITY (critical/warning) is told by the state mark's HUE
// and its SHAPE together — an alert circle for critical, a triangle for
// warning (`StateMark` below) — so colour is never the only carrier, and in
// words by that mark's own `aria-label`. Nothing else in the row changes: no
// fill, no edge, no plate, no tag, so the checklist reads as one surface from
// top to bottom.
//
// That accessible label is deliberately a SEPARATE helper from
// `rowStateDetailText`, which feeds `rowVisibleDetailText` below — the
// visible `.appdoc-detail` line. Folding the two into one string would print
// the severity a second time on screen, inside the detail line ("Critical —
// Failed — <detail>") — see appdoctor-lib.ts's comment on the two functions
// for why they must stay split. The visible line also drops the bare
// "Failed" word a settled fact failure would otherwise carry — the mark's hue
// and shape already say a row failed — and drops
// entirely for a passing row, since every checklist label is already a
// complete statement on its own. `rowVisibleDetailText` only prints
// `rowStateDetailText`'s output when it is a candidate's "N to review"
// count, real information the detail sentence does not otherwise carry.
//
// THE HEADER carries the whole summary in one line (`readinessCount` and
// `readinessSentence`, appdoctor-lib.ts): how many rows want an answer, out
// of how many were asked. That is the only tally in the dialog — a SECTION is
// a muted label sharing the row's left inset and nothing else (no card, no
// disclosure, no count), because a count above rows the reader can see is one
// fact told twice.
//
// A SETTLED row — passed, skipped, or never asked — is one dim line at body
// weight with 4px less vertical pad, so a run of them reads as a block to
// skip rather than as items to read. The rows that want something keep the
// full box, the label's weight, the detail line, the findings and the action.
// Nothing else about the box differs: one radius, one left inset, one hover
// wash, whatever the state.
//
// Per-row Fix/Review creates ONE task on just that row; the footer's "Fix N
// issues" creates one task covering every currently failing row at once, and
// its note names the candidates in that N, since the task reads those rather
// than rewriting them (`reviewNote`, appdoctor-lib.ts). Both
// share the same one-live-fix-session-per-app rule server-side (409): two
// sessions rewriting one folder is a merge nobody asked for.
//
// THE REPORT IS FETCHED FRESH ON EVERY MOUNT. The dialog is mounted behind
// `{open && …}` and the tab is not `keepMounted`, so opening either again is
// itself a re-run. The tab has no close to reopen, so its footer also offers
// a "Re-run" (the hook's `load`); the dialog does not need one.
//
// Shared by the shell and the explorer, so it spells its own routes rather than
// importing either app's helpers (an app may not import the shell — the same
// reason Preview.tsx spells `/apps/<folder>?_tab=tasks` by hand).
