// Persistent server-health card, rendered at the foot of the shared
// notification stack (NotificationHost owns its placement — this component
// positions nothing). Unlike a toast it has no auto-dismiss: it stays until
// the server answers again, which is why it sits below the transient entries
// rather than shuffling among them.
// Polls /api/config every 5s; what each probe result means (down, reconnected,
// update-refresh, update-restart, auto-reload) lives in lib/server-status.ts —
// this component owns the polling, the timers and the cards. The backend is a
// native app the user launches, so the "down" fix is always "reopen the app",
// not a CLI command. Fully self-contained: mounted once in App's #app root so
// it survives the epoch-keyed view remounts. Styling is .server-status* in
// styles/notifications.css.
//
// ONE OF THE STATES IS NOT A CARD. `update-refresh` — the served bundle
// moved, a refresh fixes it — is a blocking dialog on the shared platform
// Modal chassis (`UpdateDialog`), because the page is talking to a version
// that is going away and every click from here is a guess about which side
// answers. Suppressed on a dev server, where the two versions disagree by
// design, and forced up as a PREVIEW there under `?update_modal=1` — the
// three modes are `updateDialogMode`'s, stated once in server-status.ts.
//
// THE RESTART CASE IS NOT DRAWN HERE AT ALL (SPEC-update-notifications.md).
// It used to be a bare-link card, then `UpdateDialog`'s "restart" mode
// (D1) — both gone now, replaced by a status-bar notification
// (`platform/ui/UpdateNotifier.tsx`) that owns the decision AND the in-flight
// narration through `restart-flow.ts`'s stages. What THIS component still
// owns about a restart is narrower: while one is in flight (or the install
// just landed) the "down" card must stay suppressed (step 5) — the app being
// gone is the restart working, and two surfaces telling opposite stories
// about the same outage is the bug that step fixed. The cap
// (RESTART_GIVE_UP_MS) is what gives the card back.
