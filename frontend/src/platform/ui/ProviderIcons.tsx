// Per-provider icons for the Mounts page provider picker. Same house
// style as FileIcons/FinderIcon: viewBox 0 0 24 24, fill none, stroke
// currentColor, round caps/joins — hand-written paths, no npm dependency.
//
// Deliberately MONOCHROME rather than brand-coloured. Three reasons: it matches
// the rest of the shell's iconography, it survives light/dark without a second
// asset, and it keeps us clear of reproducing trademarked logo artwork. Tint
// comes from CSS (.mount-provider-icon--<key> in shell.css) exactly the way
// .file-icon--<variant> works, so the SVG itself is colourless.
//
// The glyphs are shape-suggestive, not logo-accurate: Drive's divided triangle,
// Dropbox's stacked diamonds, a package for Box, a bucket for S3 (which is what
// S3 calls its containers anyway), a server stack for S3-compatible services,
// and a globe for open public data.
import type { ReactNode } from "react";

// Deliberately UNSIZED: this is the picker card's own mark, drawn as a
// full-height column beside the name, so the card's height is what sets the
// glyph's size (.mount-provider-icon in shell.css). A width/height here would
// just be overridden by that CSS and mislead the next reader.
//
// Stroke is 1.15, well under the 2 the 16px file-type icons use. The glyphs are
// drawn in a 24-unit box and rendered around 40px, so every line is scaled up
// ~1.7x — holding 2 (or even the 1.75 this had at 22px) made them read as
// markedly heavier than the rest of the shell's iconography.
