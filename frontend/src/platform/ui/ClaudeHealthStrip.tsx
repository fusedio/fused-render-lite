// The first-run heads-up: three lines on the front door saying whether Claude
// Code is there, new enough, and signed in — BEFORE a prompt has been spent
// finding out.
//
// **The failure this exists to prevent.** On a fresh install the Home hero
// invites a prompt. The app folder gets created, the session fails, and the
// TroubleCard explains it well — but the user has already typed a brief and
// watched a folder appear before learning that the thing the app is built around
// was never set up. The doctrine: a surface renders only when it works, "so
// it's never a dead link". This is that gate for everything Claude-dependent.
//
// **It is not a wizard and not a gate.** The file explorer is completely useful
// without Claude Code, and nothing here blocks it: the strip is a row above the
// page that says what is wrong and how to fix it, and it disappears the moment
// there is nothing to say. It renders NOTHING in the common case.
//
// The TroubleCard stays exactly as it is. Preflight is an addition, not a
// replacement — a CLI can break between this check and the call.
