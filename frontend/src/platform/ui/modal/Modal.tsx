// Shared modal chassis for every dialog in the app (SPEC: modal/form design
// system). Renders overlay > dialog with the a11y contract every modal needs:
//   • role="dialog" + aria-modal + aria-labelledby → the h2 (stable useId)
//   • focus trap: Tab/Shift+Tab cycle within the dialog; on mount focus
//     `initialFocus` (or the first focusable), on unmount restore the element
//     that was focused when the modal opened.
//   • Esc / backdrop / ✕ close, gated by `busy`; ✕ disabled while busy.
//   • optional `dirty` guard: the first close attempt arms the ✕ and shows an
//     inline "close again to discard" hint; the NEXT close attempt discards,
//     however long the user takes over it. Arming is cleared by going back to
//     the form (typing/clicking inside the dialog), not by a clock — see
//     `attemptClose` and the disarm effect below for why.
//     BOTH halves matter — the hint says it in words, the button says it where
//     the press happened. See the ✕ below.
// Chrome reuses the existing .deploy-* CSS (the body carries both `modal-body`
// and `deploy-body` so descendant skins that key off .deploy-body keep working,
// e.g. RowEditorModal).

              X button, i don't think that works". It worked as specified and
              was indistinguishable from broken.

              Every busy modal that must not be abandoned has a real way out in
