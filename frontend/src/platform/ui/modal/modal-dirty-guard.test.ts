// The dirty guard: its RULES (dirty-guard.ts) and its VISIBLE half (Modal.tsx).
//
// The guard itself — first close attempt arms, the next one discards — has been
// there since the chassis was written. What was missing is that the
// first press LOOKED like nothing happened: the only feedback was a 12px muted
// line in the footer, at the opposite corner from the ✕ the user had just
// clicked, gone again after two seconds. A tester pressed it and reported a
// dead click (QA, 2026-08-18).
//
// So the armed state is now on the button too, and these tests hold the three
// pieces together — the markup that sets the class, the stylesheet that gives it
// a look, and the wording. There is no DOM renderer in this suite (nothing here
// mounts React), so this reads the source, which is the same thing
// `new-task-form.test.ts` does for the `ready` expression.
