// WHICH MODAL OWNS THE NEXT Esc.
//
// `Modal` closes on a document-level keydown listener (see Modal.tsx for why it
// is on the document and not the dialog subtree), and every mounted modal has
// one of its own. So a dialog nested INSIDE another — the chat's "what was
// sent" receipt, or its kebab's delete confirm, both of which open inside
// `TaskPeek`, itself a `Modal` — closed itself and the peek around it on one
// press (Bugbot, PR #1061, High). `T` binds Esc in the capture phase and
// `stopPropagation`s so the layers peel one per press (T:11044-11052); a stack
// is that rule expressed ONCE for every caller of the chassis rather than once
// per nested dialog, and it needs no phase games.
//
// Its own module so it can be tested without a DOM: `Modal` is portal-based, so
// mounting one takes a real document, and the rule this holds is pure.
