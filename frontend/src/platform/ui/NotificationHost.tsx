// The floating notification column: one fixed, bottom-right stack holding
// the message pop-up (lib/notifications), the job pop-up and the
// server-health card. Mounted once by App, alongside `StatusBar`
// (platform/ui/StatusBar.tsx).
//
// It replaced three competing surfaces — a bottom-centre global toast stack, a
// per-pane toast each of Listing and Preview positioned and expired itself,
// and this bottom-right card — which between them meant the same "Path copied"
// appeared in two different places depending on which view raised it, and a
// toast could sit next to (or under) an unrelated card in the other corner.
// One stack, one set of stacking rules. Unlike the old toast stack, a
// message pop-up now auto-dismisses on its own after `JOB_POPUP_VISIBLE_MS`
// (SPEC-toasts-become-notifications.md, reversing D663 for client-raised
// messages only — see that spec and DECISIONS-actionable-notifications.md
// for why the job-row rule itself is unchanged) and, if its tier is
// `attention`/`trail`, is retained in the Notifications panel below.
//
// Order is oldest → newest top to bottom, so the newest message is nearest the
// bottom edge where the eye already is, and the server card sits below all of
// them: it is the one entry that outlives any toast, so it must not shuffle as
// toasts come and go. Styling is .notif-host in shell.css.
//
// TWO ENTRIES USED TO LIVE HERE AND DO NOT ANY MORE (D563, status bar
// redesign, user call: "the collapsed notification is also taking too much
// space... it is impossible to use the claude template with it"): the
// activity card (SPEC §36, work in progress — jobs and the scheduled queue)
// and the repo-updates card (SPEC §36, a repo behind its remote's default
// branch). Both are LONG-LIVED — minutes to indefinitely — and this column is
// FIXED, so even collapsed their header sat on top of whatever page was under
// it. `StatusBar` hosts them now, inside `#main`, where collapsing them
// actually gives the page its space back rather than merely shrinking a card
// still floating over it. What stays here — toasts, the job pop-up,
// `ServerStatusBanner` — is either seconds-long or exceptional enough that
// overlaying the page is the right call for it: see `StatusBar`'s own header
// comment for the two long-lived cards' reasoning, which used to live here.
//
// THE JOB POP-UP (SPEC actionable-notifications) is the one entry here that
// draws the SAME card the long-lived Notifications panel does (`JobRow`,
// reused through `JobPopupCard`) rather than a `Toast` — the user's own
// clarification was "the UI should still be the same notification card". It
// qualifies for THIS column, not the panel's, for the same "seconds-long"
// reason every other entry here does: `JobPopupCard` clears itself in well
// under 3 seconds regardless of what its job's tier keeps in the panel.
//
// Panes keep their attribution for free: in panel/tab mode each pane is its
// own document, so a pane's toast renders in THAT pane's bottom-right corner,
// not the window's. Only the top-level document shows the server card and
// the job pop-up (an embed would otherwise pop the same job once per pane,
// all saying the same thing — `App.tsx`'s own `!IS_EMBED` guard around
// `ActivityDock` already keeps a pane from ever producing one, and the guard
// here is belt-and-suspenders against that changing out from under it).
