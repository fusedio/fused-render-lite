// Big preview card for the /apps hub. Its thumbnail has three shapes, in
// precedence order:
//
//   1. `preview.png` at the app folder's root — an AUTHORED still, served as
//      bytes through /api/fs/raw. First because it is the only one the author
//      chose: a live render shows the page in whatever state it comes up in
//      (empty, mid-load, asking for a file), and a screenshot shows the app
//      making its point. It is also by far the cheapest of the three.
//      Hovering the card swaps the still for the live app (step 2's iframe),
//      and hover-end swaps it back — see the hover state below.
//   2. the app itself, live: `entry_html` in a sandboxed iframe at desktop
//      width (1280px) scaled down to fit the card.
//   3. no entry file at all — an empty thumb. The box keeps its 16/10 aspect,
//      background and top border, so the card holds its shape; it just says
//      nothing about an app that has nothing to show (D365).
//
// The precedence is a FALLBACK CHAIN, not a fixed choice, and it has to be:
// `preview_image` says a file of that name exists and is non-empty, not that it
// decodes. A corrupt or half-written PNG in an <img> renders as nothing, so a
// wrongly-confident step 1 would be a permanently blank card — strictly worse
// than the live render it replaced. An image error drops to step 2.
//
// Display-only either way: a pointer-events shield keeps every click on the
// card, which opens the app. The image is lazy via `loading="lazy"`; the
// iframe goes further — see useNearViewport below.
//
// `loading="lazy"` only defers the FIRST load, it never reclaims an iframe
// once scrolled past. A workspace with many entry_html apps and no
// preview.png would still end up with every card that has ever scrolled
// through the viewport pinned open — each a whole sandboxed page + JS
// runtime. useNearViewport instead mounts the iframe only while its card is
// near the viewport and unmounts it once scrolled well past, showing step 3's
// empty thumb in between — an offloaded card reads the same as an app with no
// live preview (D365).
