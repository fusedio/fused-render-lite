// The COPY BUTTON is the part that earns its place. Everything else here is a
// nudge toward a page; the copied block is the thing a user can paste into
// their own AI or into an issue and get an actual answer from, because it
// carries the installation it happened in — which is the fact every diagnosis
// needs and the one nobody can look up for themselves.
