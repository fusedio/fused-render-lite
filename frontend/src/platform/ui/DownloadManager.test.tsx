// PR #785 follow-up: JobRow alone returning null for a "done" job left every
// decision ABOVE it still counting the invisible row — the empty-card gate
// (`jobs.length === 0 && queued === 0`), the header's "N finished" tally, and
// `clearable` (which drew a Clear button for a row nobody could see). A
// successful job has to disappear from ALL of those, not just from its own
// row, or a lone success leaves an empty bordered box with a header and a
// Clear button over nothing — worse than the "done" row this was meant to
// remove.
//
// Rendered through `DownloadManagerView` — the pure, props-in half of this
// card, exported for exactly this file the way `JobRow` is exported for its
// own test — rather than the default-exported `DownloadManager`, which polls
// `/api/jobs` itself. Mounting THAT would mean mocking `@platform/lib/api`,
// which is shared by dozens of other test files; `mock.module` replaces it
// for the whole bun process, not just one file, and that contaminated an
// unrelated suite (`apps/ai_models/playground/client.test.ts`) the first

// timers are captured (and restored) the same way ActivityDock.test.tsx's
// own `captureTimers` is, scoped to just this describe block.
