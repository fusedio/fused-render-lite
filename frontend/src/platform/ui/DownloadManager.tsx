// The activity card — ONE card at the foot of the notification stack for every
// piece of work in progress: the long-running operations any page reported
// (SPEC §36, D244). A scheduled message's own run is NOT among them (D661,
// user: "a task is not something I even want in the activity. that was added
// unintentionally") — it gets its own toast on finish/fail
// (platform/lib/schedule-toast.ts), never a row here.
//
// STATUS-BAR MERGE, THEN A PARTIAL REVERT: this chip absorbed the two other
// PERSISTENT-status chips that used to sit beside it — Models
// (shell/ModelsDock.tsx) and Engines (shell/EnginesDock.tsx), both deleted at
// the time. A follow-up revision then split Models back out into its own chip
// (shell/ModelsDock.tsx again, resurrected) because the user relies on that
// chip's own filled/outlined dot to know whether the machine is holding any
// model weights, and a dot shared with jobs/engines answered a different
// question. Engines stayed merged here — nothing comparable was ever asked of
// its own indicator. So this panel draws up to TWO labelled sections in order
// — Running (job rows), then Background tasks (engine rows) — a section only
// when it has rows, a heading only when 2+ sections are present at once. See
// `EnginesSlot` below for why the row rendering could move into platform (it
// only needs `platform/lib/api` types) while the poller that FEEDS it stayed
// in shell (`shell/ActivityDock.tsx`, the sole caller of this component). The
// chip's own `StatusDot` still answers a narrower question than "does this
// chip have anything to show": see `runningCount`, below, for why a running
// engine alone leaves it unfilled.
//
// It exists because that work used to be invisible the moment you looked away
// from it: a page pulling an 8GB model drew its own bar inside itself, and the
// shell tears a page's frame down on every navigation, so browsing to another
// file while the download ran left multi-GB of traffic happening with nothing on
// screen to say so. The record lives on the server (fused_render/jobs.py), which
// is why this survives the reporter's document — and why it can show work
// reported by a page in a different browser tab, or by a detached Python worker
// posting to /api/jobs itself.
//
// A JOB LEAVES THIS CARD THE MOMENT IT IS TERMINAL (D662, broadening D586):
// "running activities are shown in jobs and after done, a completed message
// goes to notifications" — the whole sentence, not only its failure half.
// `inFlightJobs` (jobs.ts) is what this card draws; `RepoUpdatesDock.tsx`
// draws every job `inFlightJobs` excludes, off the same `onJobsReported`
// snapshot this card forwards on every poll.
//
// EVERYTHING FOLDS NOW (D562, user call 2026-08-27, reversing D558/D559's
// exemptions): collapsing hides every row, with no kind pinned outside it.
// The user's rule is that there is no such thing as a "non-foldable card",
// full stop.
//
// COLLAPSED IS NOW A CHIP, NOT A SHORT CARD (D563, status bar redesign, user
// call: "the collapsed notification is also taking too much space... it is
// impossible to use the claude template with it"). `.dl-toggle` — the
// category name, its count (D573), the aggregate percentage — is the WHOLE
// of what renders while collapsed; every row renders only inside the panel
// that opens when the card is expanded, and so does not survive a collapse.
// That reachability requirement is gone on purpose, not merely forgotten: the
// chip's whole point is to cost the page nothing but one summary line, and a
// button on it would be a second thing competing for that line's very little
// room. Nothing here rewrites the stored preference; it is only ever changed
// by the user pressing the chip.
//
// PLACEMENT MOVED (D563): this card used to sit in NotificationHost's fixed,
// floating column with the toasts and the server card, ABOVE the server card
// and BELOW the toasts by lifetime (a toast is seconds, work in progress is
// minutes, the server card outlives the session) — but a FIXED column
// overlays page content even collapsed, which is what made a page like the
// Claude template unusable under it. It is handed to `StatusBar` now instead,
// mounted inside `#main` where it RESERVES layout space rather than floating
// over it; the toasts and `ServerStatusBanner` are unaffected and
// stay in NotificationHost's column, since none of them are long-lived
// enough to be worth a permanently reserved strip. This component still
// positions nothing itself — `StatusBar` owns the chip's place in the bar,
// and this file's own CSS classes own the panel floating above it.
//
// Cancel is a REQUEST, not a kill (jobs.py `request_cancel`): the shell has no
// idea what the work is or which process is doing it, so the ✕ sets a flag the
// reporting page reads on its next tick and acts on. The row therefore says
// "Cancelling…" until the work actually stops, rather than lying about it.

//
// WHY: a `.dl-panel` floats above the page and is dismissed by an outside
// pointer-down or Escape. That is popover behaviour, and a popover that
// restores itself across reloads covers the page on every navigation. "Open"
// is a statement about this moment, not a preference worth remembering. The
// user's own report was not the auto-open path at all — D587's `neverOpen` was
// intact — it was a stored `"0"` from having clicked Models open earlier,
// faithfully restored on every load since, which is indistinguishable from a
// bug from where they sit. This also makes D582's arbiter trivial instead of
// arbitrary (nothing wants to be open at mount) and finally makes "never auto
// open" hold on EVERY path rather than all but one.
//
// The transient `autoOpen`/`autoClose` overrides are untouched; opening is an

  // character plus an ellipsis conveys nothing while still costing width.

  // whenever the title names the model, so it is the field that stays
  // relegated. As `secondary` it gets the panel's full width and needs no
  // shrink factor.
  // Suppressed when it just repeats the title (`_start_resident`/`load` set
  // both `title` and `model` to the same model id) — otherwise a model-load
  // row would draw the model name twice. The MODEL name only, not the whole
