// Full Disk Access warning — a strip on the front door, in the same posture
// and styling as ClaudeHealthStrip.
//
// It replaced the touch-triggered notification card (FdaCard). The card only
// appeared once the session read under a protected folder, on the theory that
// the per-folder Allow prompts would cover everyone else. On a fresh machine
// that theory fails in the worst way: a backend read under Desktop/Documents
// while the app is not frontmost gets its prompt suppressed and a DENY cached
// silently, so the user's first sign of trouble is "permission denied" with
// no prompt ever shown and no idea why. Full Disk Access — granted once in
// System Settings — sidesteps the whole category.
//
// WHEN it shows is the design: not at launch (an up-front whole-disk ask on
// a machine whose files all open fine is the wrong first impression), but the
// moment an fs route actually hits a PermissionError — the server flips
// `fda.denied` on that first denial (fused_render/shell/fda.py), which also
// catches the silent-deny case above, since the cached deny still surfaces
// as EPERM on the next read. Until then this renders nothing.
//
// STATE lives in platform/lib/fda.ts — one store, one poll, one set of words,
// shared with the onboarding FdaStep — so every copy of this strip (Home,
// /apps, the explorer's AccessDenied card) and the wizard agree. This file
// only decides what to render for a given snapshot: absent → nothing;
// granted → nothing (plus one toast if we were showing); pending_relaunch →
// the Relaunch button; denied → the steps. "✕" acknowledges the CURRENT
// denial on the server — every tab converges to hidden — and the next
// PermissionError raises strip and toast again: dismiss is "not now", not
// "never".
