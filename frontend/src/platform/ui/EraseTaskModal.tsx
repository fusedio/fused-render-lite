// The one dialog on the Tasks page that DESTROYS something.
//
// Archive files a task away and keeps its conversation (D306); this deletes the
// Claude session behind the task — the transcript, the read/triage bookkeeping
// and any run still booked — and there is no way back. So no control anywhere on
// this page goes straight to the call: every trash press becomes a target the
// reader has to read back first, which is the whole reason this component exists
// rather than a `confirm()`.
//
// ONE MODAL, FOUR SURFACES (design.md §2): the List row's trash, the Cards
// wall's trash door, the Cards popup's head and the Claude chat's own kebab item
// all say the same words, because a reader who learns what "Delete forever"
// means in one place must not have to relearn it in the next.
//
// It LIVES IN PLATFORM for the fourth of those (Akshil, 2026-09-08): the chat is
// an app, an app may not import from `shell`, and the chat had grown a
// second dialog of its own with the same copy re-typed into it — which is how the
// two drift. `shell/EraseTaskModal.tsx` re-exports this for the three Tasks-page
// call sites. Both dependencies were already platform-only, so nothing else
// moved.
//
// Shaped on ai_models/local/DeleteDialogs — the app's other irreversible dialog:
// shared `Modal` chassis, the target named in the title, the consequence in the
// body, the path in mono, and a `btn-danger` whose word is the verb rather than
// "OK".
