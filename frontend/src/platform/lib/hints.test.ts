// The instant tooltip's two hard parts, driven directly: WHICH element a point
// resolves to, and WHERE the panel lands.
//
// Both were shipped wrong once. The resolver has to see through an overlay,
// because the Tasks row's navigation is an `<a>` stretched over the whole row
// and the title underneath it is what carries the caption — `event.target`
// alone answers "the link" and the caption never appears. The placement has to
// flip near a viewport edge, because the version before this one was positioned
// against its own element and hung outside the scroller on the last cell of a
// row.
//
// Read out of the source rather than run in a DOM: bun's test runner has no
// layout, so `elementsFromPoint` and `offsetWidth` are both zero there — a test
// that "passed" against a fake would not have caught either bug. What is checked
// here is the shape of the decisions; the geometry was verified in a real
// browser (see the PR).
