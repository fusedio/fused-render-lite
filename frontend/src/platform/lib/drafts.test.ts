// ONE RECORD, VERSIONED — the drafts module's whole concurrency story (design
// "Drafts: one record, one key, versioned, pushed", §2).
//
// What this file used to test was a coordination layer: a `spent` set, an
// in-flight map, a `stop`/`settle`/`resume` protocol, an `era` counter — all of
// which existed to order one document's writes against its own reads, and all of
// which are gone. There is ONE writer per key now (`draftSyncer`), and what is
// tested here is the thing that replaced them: a desired state, one request in
// flight, a version between documents and a sequence within one.
//
// Driven through the real hook — react-test-renderer, no DOM, the same tool
// JobRow.test.tsx and apps/explorer/listing/hook-harness.ts both use — because
// what matters is a SEQUENCE that grepping the source cannot show. The harness
// below is a small reimplementation of hook-harness.ts's own `renderHook`, not
// an import of it: `platform/` may not import `apps/` (scripts/check-boundaries).
//
// Every test drives the write through `flushNow()` rather than waiting out the
// real debounce timer: `bun test` runs every suite in one process, and a real
// `setTimeout` left pending past a test's own assertions is exactly the kind of
// leftover that lands during whichever OTHER file happens to be running when it
// fires. `flush()` dispatches synchronously, so nothing here waits on a clock.
