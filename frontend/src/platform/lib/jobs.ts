 *  is a FAMILY key (`sys:ai-image:<id>` -> `sys:ai-image`), and terminal rows
 *  are kept until dismissed (D663) - so grouping purely by `(page, group)`
 *  folds a page's ENTIRE history for that family into one group. Once a
 *  second model download has ever existed on a page, every future download
 *  in that family joins the same permanent group: it never pops on its own
 *  completion again (`popupJobs` excludes any multi-member group), an old
 *  failure pins the group in "Needs you" forever, and the subline counts
 *  jobs from hours ago ("17 of 18 done").
 *
 *  THE FIX: a group must mean one BURST of work, not one family of work.
 *  Within a `(page, group)` family, jobs are further split into CLUSTERS by
 *  activity gap - sort the family by `started_at`, walk in order, and start
 *  a new cluster whenever a job's `started_at` is more than `GROUP_GAP_MS`
 *  past the latest `finished_at ?? started_at` seen so far in the CURRENT
 *  cluster. The final grouping key is `(page, family, cluster)`, not just
 *  `(page, family)` - so a burst from hours ago can never absorb a job that
 *  starts today, no matter how many bursts came before it in the same
 *  family. See `clusterFamily` below for the walk itself.
 *

// The floating pop-up card (SPEC actionable-notifications, user: "when
// getting notifications, ensure the latest notification always pops up and
// auto disappears under 3 seconds. they still stay in the list"). `tier`
// narrowed to mean retention only (see `JobTier` above) is what makes this
// possible for `attention`/`trail`/`transient`: every terminal job in one of
// those three is news worth a card, whether or not it earns a lasting row.
// `silent` is the one exception — its whole point is to pop NOTHING on a
// successful finish (a resident model load/unload: the running row already
// said as much, so "done" is not news).

/** Every terminal job that should pop a card. Quieted (2026-09-23, user: no
 *  more START/success popups — see DECISIONS.md D888): a floating card is
 *  now reserved for `error`/`cancelled` only. `state === "done"` (a clean
 *  finish, whatever the producer's declared `tier`) is excluded outright — a
 *  running row, or the chip's own progress line, already said the work was
 *  happening, so a successful finish is not news worth interrupting for.
 *  This is why the old presence-suppression check (`isOpenAnywhere`) is gone
 *  from this function: it only ever gated a SUCCESS pop, and success never
 *  pops here any more regardless of where the user is.
 *
 *  `mergedRows` still runs first, for the same reason `terminalNotifications`
 *  runs it first: a render waiting on a shared model load must not pop the
 *  load's own id as a second card the instant it goes terminal, one poll
 *  ahead of the waiter noticing and clearing its own `waiting_for`. The
 *  `sys:schedule:*` exclusion (D661) is independent of tier and applies here
 *  exactly as it does in `jobRows` — a scheduled message's run is not a job
 *  anyone asked to watch.
 *
 *  A MULTI-MEMBER GROUP'S OWN MEMBERS ARE EXCLUDED HERE (SPEC-quiet-
 *  notifications.md §3) — their only remaining pop (a member `error`/
 *  `cancelled`) is handled by `groupPopupTick` below instead, on the group's
 *  own rule, not on this function's per-job terminal rule. A group of one is
 *  unaffected — it is excluded from nothing extra, so a lone job's own

 *  THE FIRST-TICK BACKLOG PROBLEM: a poller's very first read after a page
 *  load or refresh sees every already-terminal job at once — naively popping
 *  on "this job is terminal and I haven't popped it yet" would replay the
 *  whole backlog as a burst of cards the instant the page opens. `isFirstTick`
 *  is the caller's own flag for "this is the very first call this poller has
 *  ever made" (a ref initialized to `true` and flipped to `false` right
 *  after); on that call every current candidate is seeded into the returned
 *  `seen` set with no popup. This is the frontend twin of `_seen_running` in
 *  `fused_render/server/routers/index.py` — same shape, same reason: a fact
 *  this process never watched happen is not news to it.
 *
 *  LATEST WINS; NO STACKING — "the latest notification always pops up", not
 *  a queue of them. When more than one id is new in the same tick, the one
 *  that pops is whichever has the newest `finished_at`, not whichever
 *  `list_jobs` happened to return last. `list_jobs` sorts by
 *  `(started_at, id)` (`fused_render/jobs.py`), so its own tail is only the
 *  job that STARTED last — a short render that finishes behind an
 *  already-running model load becomes a fresh candidate in the same tick as
 *  the load's own completion, and the load, having started second, would win
 *  the old order-based pick even though the render is what actually just
 *  finished and is what the user is waiting on.
 *
 *  `seen` is REBUILT from this tick's candidate keys every call, exactly like
 *  `trackSeenIds` above, rather than only ever grown — a `popupKey` is a
 *  one-shot fact about a single terminal event, so once that event's key is
 *  no longer among the current candidates (dismissed, cleared, swept, or

// user who just folded it. An id that DISAPPEARS (cleared, dismissed,
// forgotten, the server no longer reporting it) falls out of the returned
