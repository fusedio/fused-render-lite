// The right-click menu on an app card, in macOS Finder order. Sibling of
// appEntry.ts and for the same reason: every surface that renders an app card
// should offer the same entries, and a builder that is a plain function of the
// AppInfo can be tested without a DOM.
//
// The entry this menu exists for is "Open in Explorer" — the app's FOLDER in
// fused-render's own explorer, as distinct from "Reveal in Finder", which hands
// the path to the OS file manager.
//
// It is distinct from "Open" again, and for the ordinary app (a folder with a
// page) this is the entry that answers the other half of the card: "Open" lands
// on the app's entry PAGE (appEntry, D269), so this is the only entry that is
// ALWAYS the folder — the files around the page, which is where you go to edit
// the app rather than use it. For one release the two landed in the same place
// (D264's card opened the folder) and this entry was kept for the lone non-page
// `entry` case alone; it has its own job back.
