// Everything the `_snapshot` shell URL param needs: the carry rule, the
// resolved-snapshot singleton, the rewrite rule, and the small pure helpers
// (`isSha`, `shortSha`, `snapshotSrc`, `snapshotListing`) Preview.tsx and
// Listing.tsx build the feature's actual UI out of.
//
// LIVES IN platform/, NOT apps/explorer/, though the feature is explorer-only
// — the reason is the same one appEntry.ts, appAnnotation.ts and
// dismissOnOutside.ts already state for themselves: platform/ never imports
// from apps/ (no existing platform module does, and router.ts's own comments
// about /apps/<tag>/<name> never resolve to an import) — it is the boundary
// that keeps a platform-level concern like routing from depending on any one
// app's internals. `router.ts::navigate` is exactly such a concern, so the
// carry rule it calls has to sit beside it.
//
// ONE MODULE, NOT TWO: this used to be split with a thin re-export living at
// apps/explorer/lib/snapshot-param.ts, each with its own test file — two
// names for the same rule invited exactly the "which one do I edit" question
// a later change would eventually get wrong (code review finding A2). Every
// function here is pure string/object logic with no apps/ dependency, so
// there was no boundary reason for the split: apps/explorer (Preview.tsx,
// Listing.tsx) imports this module directly, the same direction router.ts
// already takes.
//
// THE CARRY RULE. `_snapshot=<sha>` survives a navigation exactly when the
// DESTINATION is still inside the app folder the sha was resolved against —
// the same file, a sibling file, a subfolder, all carry; a breadcrumb hop out
// of the app folder, or a hop into an unrelated app, both drop it. A sha from
// one app's history says nothing about another app, or about the workspace
// above it.

// What one `/api/git/snapshot` resolution produced: the sha it was asked
// about (not part of that response — the caller already knows it, having
// asked with it) and the two paths the response named. `dir` is what
// Listing.tsx rewrites a directory listing's fetch target to (mirroring
// static/runtime.js's own `rewritePath`, so the explorer's listing and every
// template under the app agree on what a snapshotted read means); `app_dir`
// is the live folder `carries` checks navigations against.
export interface ResolvedSnapshot {
  sha: string;
  dir: string;

  // The snapshot's OWN entry page — `GET /api/git/snapshot`'s `entry` field,
  // computed by `app_entry()` against the EXTRACTED tree, never the live one
  // (fused_render/server/routers/git_snapshot.py). Optional: only the app
  // page's own hook (shell/useAppPageSnapshot.ts) currently has a caller that
  // asks what a COMMIT's entry page was; the explorer's consumers (Preview.tsx,
  // Listing.tsx, useSnapshotForFolder.ts) preview one specific FILE, not "the
  // app's entry", and never read this. Code review finding 3 (app page
  // version dropdown pass): a caller holding only `dir`/`app_dir` and
  // rewriting the LIVE entry's path against them gets the wrong FILENAME the
  // moment the entry was renamed between the commit and HEAD —
  // `rewritePathAgainst` only swaps a directory prefix, and can never recover
  // a changed filename. `null` means the extracted tree genuinely has no

// during the resolve window — was lost in the copy (findings 1, 2 and 4).
// One helper, at least four callers (Preview.tsx's two branches, AppFiles.tsx,
// AppPage.tsx's Overview), is what makes the NEXT frame-building caller reach
// for this instead of re-deriving the same three rules a fifth time.
//
// `path` is rewritten against `snap` whenever `rewritePath` (default true) is
// left on. That is a no-op for a path already outside `snap.app_dir` — which
// covers a caller that already resolved its own path to the extracted tree
// (AppPage.tsx's Overview passes `snap.entry` itself, already under
// `snap.dir`, not `snap.app_dir` — see that field's own comment on why a
// directory-prefix swap could never have produced it) exactly as safely as it
// covers the ordinary case of a still-live path a caller hands in unchanged
// (AppFiles.tsx's `file`, Preview.tsx's `fsPath`).
//
// `rewritePath: false` is for the one caller shape where `path` names a
// TEMPLATE file, not the subject being previewed (Preview.tsx's and
// AppFiles.tsx's own non-`_render` branches, which pass a content template's
// `t.path` here and carry the actual subject separately, in `extra`'s
// `_file=`). Code review finding 4 (second round): before this option
// existed, that call site rewrote `t.path` unconditionally too, on the
// unenforced assumption that a template's own path never sits under any
// app's `app_dir` (true today — built-in templates and
// `~/.fused-render/templates` entries never do) — a template that ever DID
// resolve to a path inside the snapshotted app folder would have silently
// loaded that commit's copy of the template, or 404'd if it did not exist at
// that commit, instead of the live one every other part of the page assumes
// it is running. Rather than leave that "should never happen" as a comment
// for a future path config to quietly falsify, callers whose `path` is a
// template now say so explicitly and the rewrite never runs for them at all.
//
// `sha` is the URL's raw `_snapshot` claim (or null — the caller's own
// component state, kept in sync with the URL regardless of resolve outcome,
// mirroring Preview.tsx's own `snapshotSha`); `snap` is THIS caller's own
// resolution of it, never a shared singleton (see `rewritePathAgainst`'s own
// comment on why). Returns `null` exactly when `sha` names something not yet
// (or not successfully) resolved into `snap` — Preview.tsx's `snapshotPending`
// gate (finding 4, and its own `framePending` comment on why a `null` src,
// not a live one, is what closes the mixed-era window on first paint): a
// frame built during this window has nothing honest to address — the live
// document is the wrong era, and there is no extracted one yet to point at.
//
// `extra` is any additional `&key=value` segments a caller's own mode needs
// (`_file`, `_remote`, the preview thumbnail flags) — appended between the
// rewritten path and the three snapshot params; order carries no meaning to
// a query string, so callers need not match `srcFor`'s historical ordering.
