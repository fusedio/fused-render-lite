// DRAFTS — the half-written thing, kept on the server (design.md, "Where drafts
// live: server, one file").
//
// Two kinds share one store and one contract:
//
//   * a CHAT draft, keyed on the session the composer is in — or on `new:<file>`
//     while the chat has no session yet, because a brand-new conversation only
//     gets its id at the first send (design.md, "Chat draft key"). First send
//     creates the session AND deletes the draft, so nothing is ever re-keyed;
//   * a TASK draft, keyed on a uuid the CLIENT mints at the first keystroke in
//     the New task form. A task draft never has a session: the session arrives
//     at the first run like any scheduled entry (Akshil, 2026-09-11).
//
// WHY THE SERVER AND NOT localStorage: the List/Board badge needs `/api/tasks`
// (server-rendered) to join a draft onto its task row, and a draft should
// survive the browser profile, another window, and the packaged app vs. the dev
// server.
//
// ONE RECORD PER DRAFT, VERSIONED (design "Drafts: one record, one key,
// versioned, pushed", 2026-09-16). There is no second copy of a draft anywhere
// — no sessionStorage hop, no `?message=` param, no `draft:<id>` minted from a
// chat — so duplicates and resurrections are impossible by construction rather
// than by bookkeeping. What replaced the bookkeeping is a VERSION: every record
// carries one, every write states the version it is editing (`If-Match`), and a
// write against a stale version is refused with the server's record in the body
// (409). The old `spent` set, the `inflight` map and the stop/settle/resume
// choreography all existed to order writes against reads inside one document;
// a version orders them against every document at once, including the other tab.
//
// THE ONE RULE EVERY WRITE HERE OBEYS: it must never break what the user is
// doing. Typing is not blocked, a refusal is not shown, a network error is
// swallowed. A draft that failed to save costs the user a draft; a draft that
// threw inside a keystroke handler costs them the keystroke. The ONE thing that
// does reach the screen is a 409 taken while the reader is mid-sentence — their
// words are kept and a soft toast says so, because silently keeping them would
// leave the record and the box disagreeing with nothing said about it.

// A draft arriving from the chat composer's Schedule button
// (`?new=1&message=…`) is one block of prose written for Claude, and the form
// now has two places to put it. It is SPLIT rather than dropped whole into the
// description (Akshil, 2026-08-18): the first line is what the draft is about,

// body. Here the two fields PARTITION the draft: what goes in the first field is
// removed from the second, and composeTaskMessage puts it back together on Save,
// so nothing is said twice and nothing is lost.

// THE LINE BREAK IS THE ONLY CUT (Akshil, 2026-08-18). A long first line is kept
// whole rather than clamped to a name: the field asks "What should Claude do?",
// and a clamp answers that question with two thirds of a sentence. The clamp

// losing the tail, so a long draft arrived with its opening said twice — worse
// than the long value it was avoiding. TITLE_MAX still governs a name DERIVED
// from a session's first message (shortTitle), which is a different job: that is
// the app naming a thread nobody named, where a clamp is all there is. Here the

// ---------------------------------------------------------------- the syncer
//
// ONE WRITER PER DRAFT KEY, AND IT OWNS THE ORDER.
//
// What this replaces is a page on which seven things wrote one draft — a 600 ms
// debounce, a window blur, a tab going hidden, an unmount, the send's DELETE, a
// Discard, the Schedule hop's PUT — each firing its own request, with the
// CALLERS trying to put them in order between them (`settle`, a flush chained
// behind whatever was on the wire, an `era` counter, an `inflight` promise, "the
// hop waits for the autosave"). Nine bugs came out of that layer and every fix
// added another rung to it, because the shape was wrong: ordering is not
// something six callers can each get right.
//
// So there are no writers any more, only STATEMENTS OF INTENT. `setText` says
// what the record should hold; `markDeleted` says it should not exist. The
// syncer holds the latest such statement (`desired`) and has at most ONE request
// in flight; when that request settles and the desired state has moved on, it
// sends again. Every request carries the WHOLE state — never a delta — so the
// last one to land is right by construction, and the reader's last keystroke
// always wins over anything still in the air.
//
// THREE THINGS KEEP IT HONEST ACROSS A NETWORK THAT REORDERS:
//
//   * `If-Match`: a write against a version somebody else has moved past is
//     refused (409), which is how TWO DOCUMENTS are arbitrated;
//   * `seq`: a monotonic counter per key per document, dropped server-side when
//     it is not newer than the last one applied, which is how ONE DOCUMENT is
//     ordered against itself — the one thing a version cannot do, since both of
//     this page's requests state the same version;
//   * the one-in-flight rule, which means those two only ever have to catch the
//     one case that bypasses it: the keepalive flush.
//
// THE KEEPALIVE FLUSH IS THE DELIBERATE EXCEPTION (Bugbot 4026181414, PR #1180).
// `pagehide` is the last moment anything can leave this document, and a flush
// that QUEUED itself behind an in-flight PUT never left at all: the browser
// cancels the non-keepalive request it was waiting for, and the queued one is
// never dispatched, so the last thing the reader typed dies with the tab. So a
// keepalive flush bypasses the one-in-flight rule and goes immediately, with the
// newest state and a higher `seq`. Two requests are then on the wire at once and
// the older one is harmless whichever order they arrive in — the server drops
// it, because its sequence is not the newest this page has sent.
