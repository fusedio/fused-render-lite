// noteAfter below — add nothing that mutates the filesystem outside it). Without
// that it was a five-second window in which a moved file could still be painted
// in the folder it had left, and the report was "dragging a file onto a
// breadcrumb COPIES it": the spring-load navigates to the crumb (caching that
// listing) and unmounts the source listing with its dir-watch, the drop moves

// mount — refresh === 0, so useDirListing reads through here and repaints the

// The WHOLE map goes, never one path: a rename touches two directories, a
// recursive delete a subtree, and a compress writes a sibling — path arithmetic
// over that buys nothing and can be wrong. The cache only exists to dedupe a
// double-fetch inside a single navigation, so its useful lifetime is about a
