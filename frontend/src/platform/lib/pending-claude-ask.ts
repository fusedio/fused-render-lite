// A "Fix with Claude" ask staged from OUTSIDE the target surface entirely —
// the repo-updates row in the activity card (shell/RepoUpdatesDock.tsx,
// SPEC §36), which has no chat of its own and is not even mounted in the
// same tree as the folder it is about. It stages `{path, prompt}` here, then
// navigates to `path`; whichever Preview/Listing surface mounts for that
// path next picks the ask up and delivers it through the SAME
// `claudeAskActionRef` mechanism a click inside that surface's own git
// companion would use (claude-ask.ts).
//
// Lives in `platform/lib` (moved from `apps/explorer/lib`,
// SPEC-doctor-git-ai-errors.md Part A) rather than under the one app whose
// own surfaces happen to consume it: `platform/lib/explain-with-ai.ts`
// reuses this exact mechanism for the ErrorBanner "explain with AI" action,
// and that helper is called from OTHER apps (e.g. `apps/ai_models`) that
// the import-boundary check (`scripts/check-boundaries.mjs`) forbids from
// reaching into `apps/explorer` directly. This module has no dependencies
// of its own — a plain module-level store — so the move costs nothing.
//
// This is deliberately a SEPARATE store from that file's `takeClaudeAsk`,
// not a second caller of it: `takeClaudeAsk` reads a per-COMPONENT-INSTANCE
// ref that only exists once a target surface's Claude sidebar is already
// about to boot for a prompt raised from INSIDE it — there is no such ref to
// write into before that surface has even mounted. This module is the one
// piece of state that survives the gap between "stage it" and "something
// mounts to claim it".
//
// READ-AND-CLEARED IN ONE STEP, matching the guarantee `takeClaudeAsk`
// documents (claude-ask.ts:26-30): whichever surface asks for `path` first
// gets the prompt, and the read IS the consumption, so there is no separate
// "already delivered" bookkeeping to get wrong. A second stage before the
// first is claimed simply overwrites the one slot — there is only ever one
// pending cross-navigation ask at a time, matching there being only one
// activity card and one button press at a time.
//
// A URL PARAM WAS REJECTED for the same reason claude-ask.ts's own header
// rejects one for its pull: the prompt holds a git error and repo state
// verbatim (arbitrarily long, arbitrary characters), and a bookmarked or
// reloaded URL replaying a stale error into a brand-new conversation is
// exactly the bug that shape reintroduces — worse here, since the ask would
// ride along on every navigation to that folder from then on rather than
// just the one that raised it.
//
// EXPIRES ON A TIMEOUT, for the same class of bug one more way: if the
// navigated-to surface never reaches a ready Claude route (Claude Code not
// installed, the gate refuses, the user navigates somewhere else first and
// only comes back to this folder later), an un-expiring slot would sit here
// and get delivered to that LATER, unrelated visit — a stale error replayed
// into a brand-new conversation, the exact failure this module's header
// already rejects a URL-carried ask over. `PENDING_TTL_MS` is generous
// enough to cover the real navigate-then-mount-then-gate-settles window
// (seconds, not the width of a whole session) without giving a truly stale
// ask a second life.

// A stage NOTIFIES, on top of writing `pending` (Bugbot finding 17b, code
// review 2026-08-27). Both consumers of this module — Listing.tsx and
// Preview.tsx — used to pull the staged prompt from an effect keyed only on
// `[fsPath, claudeReady]` (or Preview's `[fsPath, claudeAskRoute,
// suppressForListing]`). That misses the COMMON case: the user is usually
// looking at the very repo whose card just failed, so the explorer is
// already sitting on `path` with Claude already ready when the second stage
// lands. `navigate(path)` is then a no-op — neither dep changes — so the
// effect never re-runs and the prompt sits in `pending` until it expires,
// unseen. `stagedVersion` is a monotonic counter every stage bumps
// (including a second stage for the SAME path), and `subscribePendingClaudeAsk`
// lets each consumer's `useSyncExternalStore` add it to their own dependency
// array alongside their existing deps — so a stage while already mounted
// re-runs the effect even when nothing else changed. This does not replace
// path-matching: `takePendingClaudeAsk` below is still what decides whether
// THIS surface's path is the one being asked for; the version only decides
// WHEN to check again.
