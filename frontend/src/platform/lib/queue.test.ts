// THE PROJECT QUEUE'S WORDS (platform/lib/queue.ts).

// Every string three surfaces say about one waiting task is built here, so this

// 2026-09-12 and the caption's half again on 2026-09-19 (Akshil), and each test
// below names the sentence it retired, because a caption that reads fine in
// isolation is exactly the kind of thing that drifts back.
