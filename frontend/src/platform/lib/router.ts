//
// NO VIEW WRITES OR FRAMES ONE ANY MORE: the per-path timeline mode that

// revision's bytes on read (/api/git/show) with nothing on disk. The flag stays
// because trees an older version left behind are still browsable by URL, and
// because it is the shell's one "you are being framed" bit (the fourth
// consequence below) — but it currently has no producer inside the app.
//
// One flag, and three of its four consequences are chrome that acts on the
// listing AS A LIVE FOLDER and has no meaning over a frozen copy:
//
//   * the breadcrumb, whose crumbs walk ABOVE the framed directory — straight
//     into the snapshot cache's own internals (`~ / .fused-render / branches /
//     … / app-versions / <hash> / <sha>`), a path the user never chose and
//     cannot act on;
//   * the "Browse contents" mode chip, which over a snapshot dir offers the
//     folder's counterpart mode — a Claude chat ON THE EXTRACTED COPY, which is
//     nonsense pointed at a frozen tree;
//   * the "Open as app" chip, same argument. (That chip is gone outright now —
//     D264 removed the app concept — but the flag still suppresses the two
//     above, which is the same reasoning applied to the survivors.)
//
// The fourth is about being FRAMED rather than about being frozen: the listing
// does not open a preview pane of its own (Listing.tsx). A snapshot is embedded
// in some view's column — the whole reason this flag exists — and a column wide
// enough to read is also wide enough for the listing's own split, so the
// browsable snapshot grew a second preview inside the first. It rides on this
// flag because a "you are being framed" bit would have exactly one writer, the
// same one, in exactly the same place.
//
// A param and not a prefix (a third `/explorer/frozen/` route) because this is
// the SAME view of the same path — only its chrome differs — and the shell
// already carries exactly this kind of framing flag on this exact surface:
// `modechip=false` was its predecessor until D237's only producer went away,
// with the SPEC noting the opt-out "comes back with that caller". This is that
// caller. (`preview=false`, the listing's own pane, used to ride beside it too;
// that one is gone as a PARAM — its job is the fourth consequence above, folded
// into this flag rather than kept as a second one nobody could write alone.)
//
// Read ONCE at module init, like IS_EMBED: both prefixes are served by full page
// loads, so the framing cannot change without one, and a value read per render
// would be a second source of truth for a fact that never moves.

// AM I A PANE OF A SPLIT? — the third framing flag, and the only one that is
// not a fact about this document's own URL.
//
// A panel pane is a whole shell loaded at `/explorer/embed/<path>`, so from the
// inside it looks exactly like a top-level window: it owns its bar chrome
// (`barChrome && !embedded` is true in there), it reflects sort/`_side` into its
// own address bar, it registers document-level keys. That is all deliberate —
// a pane IS a browsing context, and everything in it should behave. The one
// thing it must not do is grow the listing's own preview pane: the user already
// answered the layout question by splitting, and half of a window is not two
// readable columns. Exactly the argument Preview.tsx makes for the FILE
// sidebar's `splitCapable`.
//
// So why not `IS_EMBED`, which is what `splitCapable` uses? Because it is too
// coarse for THIS surface: it is also every TAB (Tabs.tsx frames the same
// /embed shells), and a tab is full-window — there is no split, nothing was
// answered, and its folder listing should keep the pane it has always had. It
// is also bookmark cards and any external embed. `splitCapable` can afford the
// looseness (a tab's file view genuinely doesn't want a second split either);
// a folder listing cannot.
//
// And the panes themselves carry NOTHING to tell the two apart: Panel and Tabs
// both build their iframe src through layout-codec's `embedSrc`, byte for byte
// identical. A marker param would be the obvious fix and is a trap — `navigate`
// deliberately drops the query on every hop (see there), so `?_pane=1` would
// survive exactly until the user clicked a folder inside the pane, and keeping
// it would mean adding a second exception beside `snapshot=1` to carry a bit
// the host already knows.
//
// So ASK THE HOST. Climbing to an ancestor's URL is the shell's existing
// same-origin idiom, not a new one: the template runtime reads its params off
// ancestor URLs the same way (D3/D4/D46), and panel/tab shells already reach
// down the other direction (readEmbedLoc reads a pane iframe's live location).
// The host's pathname is the route sentinel itself, so there is no flag for
// anyone to write, forget to write, or write inconsistently — one producer, and
// it is the route.
//
// Climbs the whole chain rather than checking `parent` alone: a listing can sit
// two frames deep inside a split (a pane showing the bookmarks page, whose
// cards are embeds of their own), and being three levels down in a pane is
// still being in a pane. `top` terminates it; the try/catch is for a
// cross-origin ancestor (an external embed), where the answer is "not a pane" —
// the same safe direction the flag's other cases point.
//
// Read ONCE at module init, like the two above, and for a stronger reason than
// theirs: a document cannot be re-parented into or out of a frame, so the fact
// physically cannot change without a fresh load of this document.

// right inside an explorer surface (the pane/tab owns its layout) and wrong
// under a foreign host — there it swaps a column the host composed for a
// different purpose, and lands in D282's recorded dead end (an embed listing
// has no chip and no header, so there is no way back). A foreign embed's chip

  // different columns, so it may only be handed from a page that owns the pane to a
  // page that has one. The destination half was always here (`opts.isDir`); the

  // BREADCRUMB up landed on a folder with its pane shut, for a folder that was open

  // to be wrong are not symmetric — guessing "carry" shuts a pane the user never
  // shut, guessing "drop" reopens one at its documented default (an absent `_side`

// AI Models page for a model load, Claude Code's settings page for an
// install, Preferences' Indexing tab for a re-index run). Both start with
// "/", so there is no syntactic tell.
//
// THE FIX IS A CLOSED TABLE, not a heuristic: every route a producer may set
// is known in advance, so checking exact membership here is no different
// from LEGACY_SENTINELS above — a route this table has not caught up to is a
// one-line fix, not a guess this function has to make correctly forever.
// Everything else is treated as an fs path, opened as a directory unless it
// names an .html/.htm file — the same test the GitHub-publish repo-root case
// and an ordinary page both pass.
// This same closed set keys `_ORIGIN_BY_ROUTE` in `fused_render/jobs.py`,
// which `origin_for_page` reads to name a page-owned job's `origin` caption
// from its own X-Fused-Page header — and `ORIGIN_BY_ROUTE`
// (`platform/lib/originRoutes.ts`), the shared leaf table both this set and
// that Python dict now derive from/mirror. DERIVED from that table's keys
// rather than a second literal list: a route without a label makes no sense
// to navigate to as a "job page" either, so the membership set and the
// label table can never drift from each other on this side.
