// Shared re-render signals. The shell has two distinct "URL changed" tiers

//    re-derived and the active view remounts (vanilla rebuilt the view DOM on
//    every route() call — a remount is the faithful equivalent).
//  - url version: ANY history write, including replaceState param writes from
//    iframe runtimes and the layout modes' `_layout` sync. Chrome (bookmark
//    buttons, active-bookmark highlight) re-renders; views do NOT remount.
//
// main.tsx wraps history.replaceState/pushState to dispatch "fused:urlchange"
// (the injected runtime writes params through the parent's history object,
// which fires no native event) — that wrapping is load-bearing for the
// layout modes and the update-bookmark flow, not just for these hooks.
