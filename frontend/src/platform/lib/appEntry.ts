// How an app card resolves, links to and opens its app — shared by every
// surface that renders one (the /apps hub's preview cards, the card context
// menu) so they can never disagree about what clicking a card does.
//
// They did disagree. Each carried its own inline copy of the rule, and Home's
// Recent row had already drifted from the hub's card. The rule now: an app card
// opens the app's ENTRY PAGE — the html FILE itself, in the explorer's ordinary
// file view — and only an app with no page at all opens its folder as a listing.
//
// That is a REVERSAL, recorded as D269 and made on the owner's explicit
// instruction: "a folder that has a top-level .html is an app, and every surface
// that shows or opens that folder should show/open THAT PAGE." For one release
// the card opened the FOLDER as a plain listing, because the destination it used
// to have was an `app` view (`?_mode=app`) under a builder route of its own,
// /apps/<tag>/<name>; the route went first (D262) and the app view itself next
// (D264), and with no "open as an app" left, the folder's listing looked like
// the only destination there was. It was not: the entry page is an ordinary
// FILE, and the explorer has always been able to open one. So the card lands on
// the page, and D269 brings back NONE of the machinery D262/D264 removed — no
// builder route, no `app` template, no `_mode`.
//
// The page is what the card is a picture of, which is the argument in one line:
// a card renders that page (live, or the `preview.png` standing in for it) and
// its title is read out of that page's <title>. Clicking a picture of a page and
// arriving at a file listing is the card not keeping its own promise — and the
// listing is one click away from the page (the crumb bar), where the page was
// several from the listing.
//
// OPENING an app is not BUILDING one: the `claude` view (the app beside a
// Claude chat) is where a new app is created and iterated on, and the create
// path still lands there (HomeHero). Everything in this module is the open path.
//
// The cards are ANCHORS, not buttons, so the browser's own "open in a new tab"
// gestures work on them: middle-click, Cmd/Ctrl-click, and the context menu's
// Open in New Tab. That needs two things to stay in lockstep — the href and the
// click handler — which is the second reason this module exists: `hrefFor` and
// `openTargetFor` resolve the same target, so a new tab and a left click can't
// land in different places.

// through the router's own codec, so an app path with a space, a `#` or a

//
// KNOWN GAP, recorded so it is not "fixed" wrongly: a Windows UNC path
// (`\\NAS\share\notes`) does not survive this. The
// codec normalizes backslashes for DRIVE-LETTER paths only, because on POSIX a
// backslash is a legal filename character. Adding an unconditional
// `replace(/\\/g, "/")` here would be worse than the gap: `urlForFsPath` strips
// leading slashes and `rootedFsPath` restores exactly one, so the UNC `\\` would
// come back as `/NAS/share/notes` — a different, silently wrong path. Real
// support means teaching BOTH directions of the codec about UNC, which no
