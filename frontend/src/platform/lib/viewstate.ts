// Per-path view state — currently the directory listing's sort (?sort/&order).
// A folder remembers how it was last viewed, so returning to it (clicking in,
// a breadcrumb, the browser Back button, or a fresh URL) restores that folder's
// own state rather than inheriting the previous view's. Keyed by canonical fs
// path; the value is a query string INCLUDING its leading "?" (or "" = none).
//
// This is deliberately a plain path->search store, not a param-carry across
// navigation: two sibling folders keep independent sorts (Desktop by Modified,
// fused by Size) and neither leaks into the other.
const KEY = "fused-render:viewstate";

// The stored string → the map, VALIDATED rather than cast. This is the only
// door into the store, so it is the one place that can honour the
// Record<string, string> the rest of the file is written against; it used to be
// a bare `JSON.parse(raw) as Record<string, string>`, and a cast checks nothing.
//
// What is on the other side of that door is a string written by someone else:
// an older build of this app, a foreign one sharing the origin, a hand-edited
// devtools value, a write interrupted half way. Three shapes have to survive:
//   • not JSON at all              → {}
//   • JSON but not an object       → {}. `null` is the one that used to get
//     through, because the guard was on the RAW string being non-empty and
//     "null" is not empty; `Object.entries(null)` throws.
//   • an object with junk INSIDE   → the junk entries are dropped and the rest
//     kept, because one bad key must not cost a user every folder's sort. A
//     non-string would otherwise reach `new URLSearchParams(42)`, which parses
//     the number's string form as a query — silently, and as nonsense.
//
// A hard failure here got much more expensive when purgeViewStateParams moved
// to pane.ts's MODULE INIT: the other callers are lazy and inside components,
// where a throw degrades one thing, but a throw at module init aborts a module
// that Listing.tsx and Preview.tsx both import — a blank app, not a blank pane.
// Exported for the tests, which have no localStorage to reach it through.

//
// Pure, and separate from the storage below, for a testing reason: there is no
// localStorage in the bun suite, so the rewriting of every folder's query
// string — the part with rules (see the empty-entry case) — has to be reachable
// without one. Returns a new map; the caller decides whether to write it.
//
// An entry left with no params at all is DELETED rather than stored as "?" or
// "": setViewState already treats an empty search as absence, so keeping one
// would be an entry that says nothing and a map that only ever grows.

//   • an entry that never carried the param keeps its exact stored string,
//     rather than being round-tripped through URLSearchParams. That round trip
//     normalizes the encoding (a space stored as `%20` comes back as `+`), and
//     while every reader here parses with URLSearchParams and cannot tell the
//     difference, a migration has no business making the STORED format depend
//     on that for entries it was not asked about.
//   • a map with nothing to strip comes back as THE SAME OBJECT. Identity is
//     how the caller below knows nothing changed, so it is load-bearing rather
//     than an optimisation.

// itself. What that costs is one READ per document load, over a map holding a
// query string per folder the user has visited.
//
// The WRITE is the part that is conditional, on stripParam having actually
// removed something (which it signals by returning a different object). That is
// not the flag argued against above — it is a fact about this run, read from the

// every entry in the store on every single document load, for the one load in a
