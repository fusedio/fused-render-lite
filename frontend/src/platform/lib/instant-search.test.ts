// A minimal stand-in for what every call site actually does with
// `INSTANT_DEBOUNCE_MS` — `window.setTimeout(run, INSTANT_DEBOUNCE_MS)`,
// with the previous pending timer cleared on every new keystroke (the same
// shape an effect's cleanup gives it) — so the debounce SHAPE itself is
// exercised against the real constant rather than duplicated by re-mounting
// FilesHome or useListingSearch here. Those two files still own the "this wired
// into the actual box" coverage (FilesHome.render.test.tsx); this is the
// "this constant, used the documented way, behaves like a trailing debounce"
// coverage, which nothing here asserted before.
// A minimal virtual clock standing in for `window.setTimeout`/`clearTimeout`,
// local to this file rather than imported from
// `@apps/explorer/listing/hook-harness` — that harness is an app-local
// module (it also pulls in react-test-renderer, which this file has no
// other use for), and the import boundary keeps `platform/` from depending
// on `apps/*`. Only the timer piece of that harness is needed here; the
// smallest faithful copy of it lives in this file instead of being shared.
