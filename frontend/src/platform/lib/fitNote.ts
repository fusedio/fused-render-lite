// The Playground's fit badge — what it SAYS, pulled out of PlaygroundTab.tsx
// for the reason `modelSize.ts`'s own header gives: there is no DOM harness in
// this repo by design, so the part with a rule in it (which words does a
// verdict draw) lives in a module a test can drive directly.
//
// SPEC AI-16c: `fit` widened from a bare verdict string to
// `{verdict, basis, footprintBytes}`, and the copy now splits on BOTH — not
// just on `verdict` the way it used to. A "measured" verdict is a FACT: this
// model actually ran here, and `footprintBytes` is what it cost, so it is
// worded as one ("Ran here, tight (28 GB)"), figure included. "declared" (a
// curator's `resident_gb` estimate) and "download" (nothing better than the
// download's own byte count) keep the ORIGINAL hedge wording, with no figure
// — both are still guesses about what the model will cost resident, and
// printing a number beside a guess would lend it the weight of a measurement
// it has not earned.
//
// A MEASURED "no" is reachable and is not a contradiction (AI-16b/AI-16c): the
// footprint store only ever holds models that ran, and the budget it is
// judged against is what was LEFT after the reserve — so "Ran here, over
// budget" describes a run that happened while nothing else was competing for
// memory, worded as what it is rather than as a prediction of failure.
//
// SPEC AI-19 adds `score` (0-100, a continuous fit score) and `runMode`
// ("gpu" | "cpu-offload" | "cpu-only") to `AiFitVerdict`, but neither is a
// new `basis` or a new `verdict` value — the copy table below is keyed on
// exactly those two, unchanged, and needs no new branch. `score` is left
// for a future bar-style rendering to consume; this badge stays text-only.
