// TWO WINDOWS, ONE RESTART — the case the real-app test of PR #1214 failed on.
//
// Akshil had two Chrome windows on the packaged app. The blocking dialog came up
// in BOTH on its own (the proactive door works per window). He pressed Restart in
// one; the other ended up showing the red "fused-render isn't running" card
// instead of the stages, which is what a window that never learned of the press
// shows once its own probes start failing.
//
// The window that is not being clicked in is, by definition, the BACKGROUND one,
// and a background window is throttled and eventually frozen — so the
// `BroadcastChannel` message, a one-shot event, is exactly the thing it can
// miss. The durable localStorage record and the wake-up re-read are what make
// the second window's story survive that; the channel is only the fast path.
//
// Both stores here run against ONE fake channel bus and ONE fake storage, which
// is what two same-origin windows actually share.
