// THE PROJECT QUEUE'S WORDS, in one place — "after TASK-038 | 2nd".
//
// Three surfaces say it: the Tasks List row, the Tasks Board card and the native
// chat (its waiting rows and the card over the composer). Two of those are shell
// and one is an app, and an app may not import shell
// (scripts/check-boundaries.mjs) — so the builder lives here, in the layer both
// may read, rather than as two copies that describe one task's place in two
// wordings.
//
// PURE, AND NOTHING BUT THE WORDS (and one href). It takes the fields the server
// already decided (`Task.queue_*`, routers/tasks.py) and returns strings. It
// does not know what a Task is, it never asks whether a folder is busy — that is
// a fact about live processes and the server's alone — and it has no opinion
// about which ink any surface spends on it.
//
// THE VOCABULARY CHANGED ON 2026-09-12 (Akshil), and the old one is worth
// naming because every one of these strings replaces one:
//
//   * `#2 in line` → `2nd in line`. A `#` is a database row number; an ordinal
//     is how a person says their place in a queue out loud.
//   * `behind TASK-041 "Pull today's news"` → `behind TASK-038`, a LINK. The
//     quoted title was a second sentence inside the first one, and it pushed the
//     one actionable token — the id — off the end of a narrow row. The title is
//     still there, on the pointer; the id is now something to press.
//   * `behind a run in this folder` → nothing at all. "Behind" with no name to
//     give was a half-sentence the reader could do nothing with; the honest
//     shape of "this is waiting and nothing else holds the folder" is to say
//     only that it is waiting.
//   * `Skip the queue` → `Run next`. Skip read as "skip this message"; the whole
//     point of the verb is that the message RUNS, next, and that nothing in
//     flight is interrupted.
//   * `queued` stays the STATUS WORD in code and on a row; `waiting` is the word
//     a count is said in ("2 queued"), because a person reading a sidebar wants
//     the state described, not the enum named.
//
// AND AGAIN ON 2026-09-19 (Akshil), for the caption alone — "3rd in line ·
// behind TASK-046" became "after TASK-046 | 3rd":
//
//   * THE HOLDER LEADS. What a reader wants from a waiting row is what is in
//     the way, and the id is also the only token on the line they can press. It
//     used to arrive last, after a clause that had already eaten the width a
//     narrow row had to give (`.tasks-row-queue` ellipsises), so the one
//     actionable word was the first to be cut.
//   * `behind` → `after`. "Behind" says the row is losing; "after" says when it
//     goes. Same fact, and the second one is the order rather than a verdict.
//   * `3rd in line` → `3rd`. "In line" is what the whole caption is about, and
//     a phrase repeated on every queued row on the page is a phrase nobody
//     reads. The bare ordinal after a pipe is a place, unmistakably.
//   * NO PLACE AND NO HOLDER is `queued` — the status word, said plainly, in
//     place of the old half-sentence "in line".
