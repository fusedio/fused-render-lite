// Background mount-health poll → global toasts. Mounted ONCE at the app root
// (App): every ~15s (and once on mount) it reads /api/mounts/health and turns
// NEW events into toasts. The backend owns DETECTION only — auto-reconnect is
// off (it churned on flap-prone mounts), so the user repairs a drop manually.
//
// Rules (per event kind):
//  - disconnected     → error "<name> disconnected", persistent, with a manual
//                       "Reconnect" action (reconnectMount + re-poll). This is
//                       the only kind the backend monitor emits today.
//  - reconnected      → info  "<name> reconnected" (defensive; not emitted by
//                       the detection-only monitor, kept for forward-compat).
