// Full Disk Access state — ONE store for every surface that talks about it.
//
// FdaStrip (Home, /apps, the explorer's AccessDenied card) and the onboarding
// FdaStep used to each poll /api/config on their own timer with their own
// idea of the state, so a grant could be "seen" by one and not another, and
// the copy drifted. This module owns the poll, the shape, and the words; the
// components render.
//
// The server (fused_render/shell/fda.py) is the only source of truth: the
// `fda` field of /api/config, or its absence. Absent = not offered (non-mac,
// dev server) or inconclusive = render nothing, and this store stops polling.
//
// The poll runs only while someone is subscribed and the answer can still
// change: `granted` is final for this process (a revoke needs a relaunch too),
// so polling stops there as well. A subscriber joining kicks an immediate
// fetch — AccessDenied's contract is that the server flipped `denied` inside
// the very request that failed, so the card's mount-time read must already
// see it, not wait for the next tick.
