 *  back. Mirrored by a `max-height` in each composer's own sheet — the
 *  `.pg-composer textarea` rule in ai-playground.css and the
 *  `.home-composer-input` rule in home.css. Those rules and this cap have to
 *  name the same number of lines, or the smaller of the two wins and the other

/** A composer textarea that grows with its own text, so a Shift+Enter newline
 *  is visible and a wrapped prompt is read whole rather than through a
 *  scroller. Hand it the value the textarea is showing; it returns the ref to
 *  put on the box, and a `grow` for anywhere the height has to be re-measured
 *  without the value moving.
 *
 *  Keyed on the VALUE rather than driven from `onChange`, because a prompt
 *  arrives in these boxes several ways: typed, seeded from the `prompt` URL
 *  param on first render, handed over from an app card, or dropped in by a
 *  starter chip. Only the first goes through onChange, and the others are
 *  exactly the long prompts — the box opened three lines tall with the rest
 *  scrolled away.
 *
 *  The cap is in LINES, not px: the box's font comes from the sheet, and a px
 *  budget silently becomes a different number of lines the moment that font
 *  moves. Measured off the box's own computed line-height on every grow.
 *
 *  The height it writes is an inline px value, which means it goes STALE the
 *  moment the box's width changes and the same text rewraps to more lines: the
 *  box keeps its old height and quietly turns into a scroller. A Clear button
 *  appearing beside the prompt used to be enough to do it; so is a sidebar
 *  toggle or a window resize. Hence the observer — and it watches the WIDTH
 *  only, because reacting to a height change would loop on the very thing this
 *  callback does.
 *
 *  CSS `field-sizing: content` would delete this hook outright. Deliberately
 *  not used: it is Chromium-only, and these sheets are not Chromium-only
 *  sheets. Revisit when Safari and Firefox ship it. */
