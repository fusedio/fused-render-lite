// The app's one INSTANT tooltip, positioned at the POINTER.
//
// It exists because the two obvious answers are each wrong in one way, and this
// page needed both halves. A native `title` is placed perfectly — the browser
// draws it at the cursor, so it can never caption the wrong row and can never be
// clipped by a scroller — but its delay is the browser's and unreachable from
// CSS: measured on the Tasks list, the FIRST hover of a session waits four to
// five seconds ("the very first time I hover, area label takes 4 to 5 seconds").
// A CSS `::before` panel is instant and unplaceable: it is absolutely positioned
// against its own element, so on the first row of a list it opens over the row
// below, and on the last cell of a row it hangs outside the scroller. Both of
// those shipped here and both were reported.
//
// Following the pointer is what has neither problem. One fixed-position element
// for the whole document, moved to the cursor, shown with no delay:
//
//   * INSTANT, because nothing schedules it — `pointerover` shows it.
//   * never displaced, because the cursor is by definition where the reader is
//     looking, so the caption cannot land on a different row's ink.
//   * never clipped, because `position: fixed` on a child of <body> is outside
//     every `overflow` on the page.
//
// Opt in with `data-hint="…"`. Deliberately NOT `data-tip`, which is the older
// CSS panel and still the right tool for the one thing it does — the status
// ring's unread count, a mark in a COLUMN of identical marks, where a 300ms
// guard against strobing is the point rather than an obstacle.
//
// One delegated listener set for the whole document rather than a React
// component per tip: the tips are on rows in a list that can hold hundreds, and
// a component and a piece of state per mark is a lot of machinery to say a file
// path.

 *  wins.
 *
 *  PIERCING STOPS AT A MODAL. `elementsFromPoint` walks the whole stack
 *  regardless of what visually blocks the pointer — a stretched link over a
 *  row's own title and a New Task dialog sitting over that same row read
 *  identically to this loop, "an element with no hint, keep going." That
 *  correctly reaches the title in the first case (same row, sharing this
 *  pointer's screen position on purpose) and wrongly reaches it in the second
 *  (a DIFFERENT row's title, portalled to <body>, that has nothing to do with
 *  the dialog above it) — hovering anywhere over the New Task card showed the
 *  caption of whatever List row happened to sit under it (Akshil, 2026-09-03).
 *  A dialog's overlay (`.modal-overlay`, every modal's chassis — Modal.tsx,
 *  FsDialogs) covers the full viewport and owns every point inside it, so once
 *  the walk reaches it the answer is decided: nothing further down the stack —
