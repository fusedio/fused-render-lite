// THE CLIENT-SIDE COUNTERPART TO `origin_for_page` (fused_render/jobs.py) —
// found and reused for the SAME reason that function exists (a `.dl-origin`
// caption naming who raised a notification row), not a second,
// independently-invented labeller. `Job.origin` is computed server-side, at
// report time, with a closed shell-route table and a `projectenv`
// project-root lookup neither of which a client-raised message's `notify()`
// call (`platform/lib/notifications.ts`) or a waiting task's own row
// (`shell/tasks-lib.ts`'s `attentionRows`) can reach synchronously — no
// request round trip happens at either call site.
//
// Until this fix this function was basename-only and disagreed, visibly,
// with `origin_for_page` on the very sources it CAN name without a round
// trip: a source of `/tasks` labelled "tasks" here and "Scheduler" there. It
// now consults the SAME shared route table (`ORIGIN_BY_ROUTE`,
// `platform/lib/originRoutes.ts`, which `router.ts` and `jobs.py`'s
// `_ORIGIN_BY_ROUTE` also read/mirror) before falling back to the bare-path
// rule. The one thing this function still cannot replicate is
// `origin_for_page`'s PROJECT-name resolution for an ordinary fs path
// (`projectenv.project_root_for` + `projectenv.display_name`), which needs
// server-side filesystem access no client call site has — that remaining
// divergence (an fs path outside the closed route table labels by basename
// here, by project name there) is deliberate and bounded: every route this
// function CAN name authoritatively, it now names identically to the server.
//
// LIVES HERE, NOT in notifications.ts: `tasks-lib.ts` (shell/) needs it too,
// and notifications.ts imports router.ts, which reads `location` at module
// scope — importing notifications.ts from tasks-lib.ts broke every one of
// its tests that don't install a DOM shim before their own static imports
// evaluate (tasks-lib.test.ts had never needed one). format.ts has no
// imports and no side effects of its own, so both callers can reach this
// without dragging that module-init chain in. `originRoutes.ts` has the same
// property, so importing it here does not change that.

  // — see `folderHref`'s comment in schedule-lib.ts: every task made from
  // inside an app targets that entry page). Fixing the one call site that fed
  // this an entry page (`tasks-lib.ts`'s `attentionRows`, now project-first)
  // removes THAT symptom, but this fallback is shared by every caller
  // (notifications.ts too), any of which can still hand it a bare entry-page
  // path with no project name to prefer. "index" alone never identifies what
  // ran — it is the same basename for every app in the system — so when the
  // extension-stripped basename is exactly "index" (case-insensitive; the
  // only entry-file spelling this codebase uses, per folderHref), walk up one
  // segment to the containing folder name instead, which is what actually
  // varies between apps. Deliberately narrow: this does NOT generalize to
  // "any uninformative-looking basename" (e.g. "main", "app") — those are
  // guesses with no evidence behind them, whereas "index" is a documented,
  // closed convention. A path with nothing above the entry file (no parent
