// that would not start, the config that would not load, a template registry

// shape: the app is fine, something *around* it is not, and the person looking
// at the screen can usually fix it in a minute IF they are told which minute to
// spend. A bare red string is the opposite of that — it names a symptom in our

// or it is broken for everyone.
//
// So every one of them resolves to the same three answers: what happened in
// plain words, what to do about it, and one block of text they can paste
// somewhere — into their own AI, or into an issue — that carries enough for
// somebody else to act on. The download page (render.fused.io) already sorts
// these into four cases with working deep links, so this file speaks its

/** How to find the installation when we cannot state it.
 *
 * SEVERAL SURFACES HAVE NO PATH TO STATE, for two different reasons. The boot
 * failure cannot describe itself at all — `/api/config` is what failed, so
 * there is no version, no platform and no install root. The others simply do
 * not pay for one: the preview fallback and the builder's hero render from
 * config alone, and the snapshot that carries the install root costs a `brew`
 * shell-out, which is not a thing to spend on a card that may render on any
 * failed preview. The chat template never knows, being a page rendered inside
 * the app.
 *
 * The brief is the same in all of them, so the line says only what is true
 * everywhere — I do not know — and never why. Naming a cause ("the failure
 * above is what would have told me") reads as a deduction, and an agent that
 * catches the app deducing wrong about its own state has reason to discount
 * everything else in the brief.
 *
 * What matters is that SOME answer is here: a brief that says "something around
 * Fused Render is broken, please fix it" and names no directory sends an agent
 * to look for an app it has no way to locate; it will guess, or ask, and both
 * cost the user the minutes this button exists to save.
 *
 * So the path is a FACT when we have it and a TASK when we do not, and the
 * order is the order people actually install this: the DMG drops
 * `FusedRender.app` into Applications, and that is where to look first. The
 * second line is the same bundle one level in — the Python the app runs, which
 * is what a fix session edits, and not something anyone would guess from the
 * .app alone.
 *
 * `brew` is here for a different question. The cask's `app` artifact moves the
 * bundle to the same place, so it does not find a NEW path; it answers who
 * MANAGES that path, which is what decides whether the fix ends in
 * `brew reinstall --cask` or in dragging a DMG over the top (`reinstall_advice`
 * splits on exactly this).
 *
 * DELIBERATELY NO `python3 -c "import fused_render"` OR `pip show`. Neither is
 * a supported way to install this, and both mislead: a bare `python3` on PATH
 * is not the interpreter inside the bundle, so it either fails or finds an
 * unrelated copy — and an agent handed that path goes and edits a copy the app
 * does not run.

 * pushing a new toast while the first stayed on screen for good). A component
 * effect is not a testable place to keep three transitions.
 *
 * The rules, in the order they are checked:
 *
 *  1. NO ERROR — the registry parses again, so whatever claim is up is now
 *     false: dismiss it, and forget the message so the same fault arriving
 *     later is announced again rather than reading as a fix that held.
 *  2. NOT ANNOUNCEABLE — this file has a better answer beside it, so say
 *     nothing AND leave any existing toast alone. Walking onto a file with no
 *     view must not take down a claim that is still true.
 *  3. ALREADY SAID — the error rides every stat; saying it once is the point.
 *  4. A DIFFERENT ERROR SUPERSEDES the old one. The registry has one state at a
 *     time, so the previous toast is stale by definition and comes down as the
 *     new one goes up. Without this the two stack, and only the newer is ever
