// Two facts about time passing, as hooks, because every surface that draws a
// relative stamp or covers a pane with a skeleton needs one of them and every
// one of them had been spelling it out again locally.
//
// `useNow` is the CLOCK: a row that says "2m ago" is a sentence about the gap
// between a stamp and now, and only one of those two moves. Nothing repainted
// it, so a chat left open for an hour still said "2m ago" and the Tasks page's
// lanes still called a run that finished forty minutes ago Upcoming, until the
// next poll happened to land.
//
// `useFallbackAfter` is the BACKSTOP: "this wait has gone on too long to still
// be a wait". Lifted from `platform/ui/ChatFrame.tsx`, which has held a timer
// over its own skeleton since the framed chat existed (CHAT_FRAME_FALLBACK_MS)
// — the same shape, wanted in three more places, and a covered pane that never
// uncovers is the worst failure any of them has.
