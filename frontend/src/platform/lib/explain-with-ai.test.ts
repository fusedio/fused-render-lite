// This module transitively imports "@platform/lib/router", whose module-init
// reads `location` at import time (router.ts:54) — so a `location`/`window`/
// `history` shim must be in place BEFORE that import executes. A static
// `import` is hoisted ahead of any top-level statement in this file
// regardless of where it's written, so `installDomShim()` (the shared,
// idempotent shim every other suite that hits this same module-init read
// already uses — see UpdateBadge.render.test.tsx, restart-store.test.ts,
// scheduleEvents.test.ts) runs first, and the module under test is loaded
// with a dynamic `await import` afterward, which runs in the order written
// rather than being hoisted.
//
// This file's own `explainWithAi` ALSO calls router.ts's `navigate()` at
// *test-call* time, not just at module-init (explain-with-ai.ts:87) — so,
// unlike a one-shot module-init read, the shim has to survive for this
// file's entire run, not just through the import above. A prior version of
// this file hand-rolled a 3-property stub and `delete`d it right after the
// import to avoid leaking a fake `window` into later suites; that broke this
// file's OWN `explainWithAi` tests (a deleted `location` makes
// `router.ts`'s `navigate()` throw `ReferenceError: location is not
// defined` when a test later calls it) and, since several other suites
// (e.g. DownloadManager.test.tsx's `useJobs` describe block) read
// `globalThis.window` without installing it themselves, relying on an
// earlier file's shim already being up, deleting it here could also strand
// THOSE suites depending on run order. `installDomShim()` is designed to be
// installed once and left standing for the rest of the process — every
// suite that needs these globals calls it defensively itself, so there is
// nothing to tear down.
