// A SESSION THE PLAN'S USAGE LIMIT STOPPED, IN WORDS — "Usage limit · resumes
// 4:00 AM" on a task row, "paused · resumes 4:00 AM" at the top of its chat.
//
// WHY IT IS NOT "blocked". The server files a usage-limited session under
// `blocked` (`Task.status`) with `blocked_reason: "usage_limit"` and the instant
// the window reopens in `resumes_at`, because for every view that sorts and
// colours by lane it IS blocked: nothing is moving and nothing will move by
// itself. But "Blocked" is the word this app uses for work that BROKE, and this
// did not break — it is waiting for a clock, and the clock is known. So the lane
// and the ring stay exactly as they are (red, Blocked, beside the runs that
// failed) and the CAPTION says the one thing that makes this row different from
// the failures around it: what stopped it, and when it starts again.
//
// PURE, AND IN PLATFORM, for `lib/queue.ts`'s reason: the Tasks List, the Board
// card and the Cards wall are shell, the chat's header is an app, and an app may
// not import shell (scripts/check-boundaries.mjs). One wording, one module, both
// layers.
