// Global notification store — replaces `lib/toast`. A client-raised message
// (a failure, a completed op) now shares the exact pop-then-retain lifetime
// the job system already has (`JobTier`, this module's own import): it pops a
// card in `.notif-host` for `JOB_POPUP_VISIBLE_MS`, then either leaves for
// good, or is retained in the Notifications panel until the user dismisses
// it — retained only if it is an error, or carries something to act on
// (`isRetained` below) — see SPEC-toasts-become-notifications.md for the
// full reasoning and DECISIONS-toasts-become-notifications.md for the
// call-by-call tier table and the later retention-narrowing reversal.
//
// SAME module-store + useSyncExternalStore SHAPE `toast.ts` used — that part
// was never the problem, so it is kept verbatim: mutations update a module
// array/value and notify subscribers, NotificationHost/RepoUpdatesDock re-read
// on every change.
//
// ONE POPUP AT A TIME, latest wins — mirrors `jobs.ts`'s own `popupTick`
// ("the latest notification always pops up", not a queue of them), NOT
// `toast.ts`'s old MAX_TOASTS=5 simultaneous stack. That old stack existed
// only because nothing ever auto-dismissed; now that every popup clears
// itself in ~2.65s, stacking is no longer what multiple arrivals need — a
// second `notify()` simply replaces whatever is still popping, exactly like a
// second terminal job replaces the first job's own popup.
//
// THE RETAINED LIST is the part with no toast.ts precedent: a message stays
// here — capped, like the old stack, at MAX_RETAINED — until
// `dismissNotification` (or the panel's "Clear all") removes it. Retention
// narrowed from "attention or trail" to "attention, or carries an action/page"
// (see `isRetained` below and DECISIONS-toasts-become-notifications.md) —
// everything else is never added to it; its popup is its only trace.

 * DEFECT (2026-09-17, live repro): `page` was ALSO tried as the row
 * identity's other half, and that is wrong in the opposite direction from
 * the one the DEFECT-3 comment above used to warn about. `page` here is
 * `taskDestination(task)` -> `taskHref` (tasks-lib.ts), which for a task with
 * a live session embeds that run's own PER-RUN `session_id`
 * (`explorerUrl(task.target || task.project, task.session_id)`). Two
 * separate runs of the identical task — the user's own "i ran it twice, I
 * just want them grouped" case — therefore get two DIFFERENT `page` values
 * and never collapse, no matter how identical their title and caption are.
 * `page` is the wrong axis on both ends: too coarse when it falls back to a
 * shared folder/global route (DEFECT 3), too fine when it carries a
 * per-run session id (this fix).
 *
 * The axis that is actually stable across repeats of "the same work" is the
 * CAPTION — "who/what made this" (`input.origin || labelForSource(input.source)`,
 * exactly `toStored`'s own caption computation, kept in lockstep with it on
 * purpose) — plus the title. A caption is set for every call site this
 * collapse exists for (the finished-task notice sets `origin` to the task's
 * project caption; other retained callers set `source`), so this is tried
 * FIRST and, when it resolves to something non-empty, wins outright — page
 * is not consulted at all in that case, which is exactly what fixes the
 * repro (same caption, same title, different page -> same family).
 *
 * Only when there is no caption at all (a caller with neither `origin` nor
 * `source`) does this fall back to the pre-existing `page`-then-`title`
 * chain, so no existing call site's behavior changes: `page` alone is still

// installed on a same-origin window, called directly, wrapped in try/catch
// for the cross-origin/sandboxed-frame SecurityError case. Direction here is
// child → parent, so every document installs the RECEIVING end on itself
// (harmless for a pane — nothing ever calls its own copy) and a pane calls
// the sending end on `window.top`.
//
// The ingest handler takes a plain `NotificationInput` — NOT a
// `StoredNotification` with the SENDER's own id baked in. Every document's
// `nextId` starts at 1, so forwarding a sender-minted id verbatim collided
// across documents (duplicate React keys in the shell's retained list, and
// `dismissNotification(1)` in one pane silently removing an unrelated row in
// another). The receiving document instead mints its OWN id from its OWN
// `nextId` sequence, exactly as if `notify()` had been called locally, and
// hands that id back to the caller so the pane can remember which shell-side
// id its own (locally-invisible) retained copy corresponds to.
//
// ROUTED THROUGH `retainAndCollapse()` — the SAME family-collapse lookup
// `notify()` itself calls — not a hand-rolled append and NOT `notify()`
// itself. This used to skip that lookup entirely and push straight onto
// `retained`, so N documents forwarding the SAME finished-task notice (e.g. N
// sub-documents watching one task) stacked N byte-identical rows instead of
// collapsing into one with `count` incremented (the live repro: three copies
// of one finished-task notice, two of another) — `retainAndCollapse` is what
// fixes that: family-collapse and the id it mints/returns now apply
// identically whether a message was raised here or forwarded in.
//
// NOT ROUTED THROUGH `notify()` (F1, 2026-09-18 fix, code review round): a
// pane already pops its OWN card, in the pane's own corner, for this exact
// message (App.tsx's `!IS_EMBED` guard means only a pane's own document runs
// `MessagePopupCard`'s upstream `notify()` call in the first place). If the
// shell's ingest handler also called `notify()`, the receiving document would
// pop a SECOND, identical card at the same moment — the exact double-popup
// `NotificationHost.tsx`'s own header comment already documents its
// `!IS_EMBED`-gating of `JobPopupCard`/`ServerStatusBanner` as guarding
// against, just for a different card. Worse, `notify()`'s "latest wins" popup
// swap (`clearTimer(exitTimer); popup = item`) would let a background pane's
// forwarded notice silently evict whatever card the SHELL itself was
// currently showing, cancelling that card's own exit timer. `ingestNotification`
// below therefore calls `retainAndCollapse` directly and stops there — the
// shell's retained list (and Notifications panel) still gets the row, but no
// popup card is ever armed for it. `isSuppressed` is still checked first
// (matching what a local `notify()` call would do), even though it can never
// actually fire here in practice: `forwardToShell` (below) forwards `origin`,
// never `source`, and `isSuppressed` short-circuits to `false` whenever
// `input.source` is absent.
//
// Re-forwarding is still structurally impossible in the ordinary
// (single-level pane -> top shell) case: `forwardToShell` only fires when
// THIS document is itself an embedded, non-top pane (its own guard, PLUS the
// F2 self-forward guard below), which the receiving (shell) document never is
