// One visibility policy for condition-gated template entries (CT-12), shared
// by every surface that renders a mode list: the title bar's ModeMenu
// (Preview), the listing's preview-pane header, the panel/tab pane bars
// (PaneModeMenu) and the Open With menu (lib/fs-actions). They used to each
// filter by hand and drifted apart, so the SAME folder could offer a mode in
// one surface and nowhere else.
//
// The policy, and why:
//
//   unconditional        -> always visible.
//   verdicts === null    -> visible, PENDING (the request is still in flight;
//                           the entry renders as a disabled spinner).
//   verdicts[mode]===false -> hidden. An explicit denial is the one signal a
//                           gate actually gives, and it is honoured.
//   no verdict for mode  -> VISIBLE. /api/fs/conditions always reports a key
//                           per gated mode, so a missing one means the call
//                           FAILED (the callers resolve a failure to `{}`) or
//                           the mode list moved on. The old posture dropped
//                           those entries ("fail closed"), which silently
//                           emptied the menu — and since a menu of one hides
//                           itself, a slow or failing gate probe made the
//                           whole mode control disappear while another
//                           surface still rendered the gated mode. Showing
//                           the entry is the least surprising failure: at
//                           worst the user picks a mode whose template then
//                           declines to render, which is visible and
//                           recoverable; a vanished control is neither.
//
// "Never strand the user in a mode the menu doesn't list" is the other half of
// the policy, but it is NOT done by pinning a denied entry into the list — an
// explicit denial hides the entry even when it is the mode currently
// requested. Pinning it looked like the kind thing to do and was worse: on a
// two-mode path it left `visible` at exactly one entry, and a menu of one
// hides itself (ModeMenu), so the view sat on a denied mode with no switcher
// and no fallback. Instead the ACTIVE mode moves: `effectiveActive` resolves a
// denied/unknown request to the default entry, the same silent fallback an
// unknown `_mode` already gets (PT-9). The denied entry then drops from the
// menu like any other, and a path whose every gated mode is denied falls
// through to the caller's own empty-list handling (Preview's FallbackPreview).

// --- content pane vs. sidebar (Preview's `_side`) ---------------------------
// Some of the modes around a file are not another WAY OF LOOKING at it, they
// are companions TO looking at it: the agent chat, the working tree it sits in,
// and the MCP tools its app folder publishes all talk about the file while you
// are viewing it as
// something (an image, a table, its source). Putting them in the same radio list
// as the real content modes made them mutually exclusive with the view they are
// about — asking Claude about a .png meant giving up looking at the .png.
//
// So on a single-file explorer preview they move to a right-hand SIDEBAR with
// its own URL param (`_side`), and the content pane's own mode list drops them.
// The partition lives here, with the rest of the mode policy, because every
// surface has to agree on which side of the split a mode belongs to — and
// because the surfaces that DON'T split (the panel/tab panes, the app builder)
// must keep offering them as ordinary modes, which is only safe while "is this a
// sidebar mode?" has one definition.
//
// `git` IS ON THIS LIST AND IS IN NO FILE'S TEMPLATE LIST, and both halves of
// that are deliberate. The registry binds it to the universal "/" DIRECTORY key
// alone and its gate refuses anything that is not a directory
// (templates/git/condition.py: a working tree belongs to the folder, since you
// stash a tree and not a file), so `partitionModes` will never pull the entry
// out of a file's own modes. The file sidebar BORROWS it from the file's parent
// folder instead (apps/explorer/lib/dir-mode.ts) and inserts it here — which is
// why the ordering below is a rule of its own rather than the registry's.
//
// `mcp` IS NOT A COMPANION. It was the third row here for a while; it is a
// DIALOG now (apps/explorer/McpDialog, off the bar's kebab), on both the file
// preview and the folder listing, because a manifest is something you configure
// and leave rather than work beside. Its `unavailableReason` below survives for
// that kebab row's tooltip; `isSidebarMode("mcp")` is false, so a registry that
// bound the template to a file would list it as an ordinary content mode.

// WHY A COMPANION IS NOT ON OFFER, in the words the switcher puts on it.
//
// The companion surfaces (the file sidebar, the folder pane) do NOT drop a
// companion they cannot show: they list it DISABLED, with one of these as its
// `title`. That is the opposite of what the content-mode policy at the top of
// this file does with a denied entry, and the difference is the surfaces, not a
// change of mind. A content mode list is OPEN — it is whatever the registry
// bound to this extension, and a user has no expectation about its length, so a
// missing entry is invisible rather than confusing. The companion list is
// CLOSED and always the same set; a user who has seen Claude / Git
// beside one file and only Claude beside the next has been told nothing about
// why, and dropping the entry would leave a one-entry menu, which hides itself
// outright, so a file outside a repository would have no switcher at all. Naming
// the reason costs one disabled row and answers the question the empty space raised.
//
// The reasons are CANNED CLIENT-SIDE and per MODE, not per verdict: /api/fs/
// conditions is bool-only by design (a gate is a condition.py returning a bool,
// not a message), and each condition is stable enough to say in a
// sentence — the working tree, the app shape, and the chat's applicability. A
// mode is equally unavailable whether its gate said no or the file never bound
// the template at all, and from the user's side those are the same fact, so one
// string covers both.

// because the list is ASSEMBLED rather than read: `git` and `mcp` are borrowed
// from the parent folder (see above) and appended, so leaving the order to the
// input would rank them by where the assembly happened to put them rather than
