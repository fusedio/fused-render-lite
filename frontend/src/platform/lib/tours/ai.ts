// The AI Models tour (/ai-models/*): what you can DO here, done rather than
// described. It used to be one line per tab — four descriptions of what each
// tab IS, which reads as a table of contents nobody asked for. Now the middle
// of it is a real turn: the tour writes a sample prompt into the composer, the
// user edits it or sends it, and SENDING is what walks the tour on to the reply
// it just produced. The two "where the next thing lives" steps follow.
//
// Steps 1–3 point at the PLAYGROUND'S OWN CONTROLS. The tour auto-fires on
// /ai-models/* and playground is the default tab, so the model rail, the
// composer and the response block are mounted for the visit this tour is
// written for. If the user landed on another subtab, those elements are not in
// the DOM and `presentSteps` (registry.ts) simply drops them — a tour never
// breaks on an absent target.
//
// Steps 4–5 point at TAB LINKS, not at the controls inside those tabs, for the
// same reason: only the active tab's internals are mounted, so a step aimed at
// the Hub search box or the benchmark Run button would drop out of every run
// that starts on playground — which is all of them. The tab link is the thing
// that is always there, and it is also the click the step is asking for.
//
// Selectors are the tab strip's own `data-tab` attributes (AiModelsPage) and
// the playground's own class names, not nth-child: a tab added or reordered in
// AI_MODELS_TABS must not silently repoint a step. Plain strings rather than an
// import of `routes.ts` — this is the platform layer, which may not reach into
// an app (check-boundaries.mjs).
import type { Tour } from "./registry";
import { prefillInput } from "./prefill";

// The playground composer, inside out: the box, the button, the reply. The
// response block is one element in two states (the dashed idle slot and the
// filled answer both render `.pg-answer-block`, see ResultSlot), so the step
// that lands on it after the send has something to spotlight either way.

// Short, harmless, and CAPABILITY-NEUTRAL: whichever model the rail has picked
// — chat, image, video — "a tiny robot reading in a cozy library" is a sensible
// thing to ask of it, where a chat-shaped prompt fed to an image model's
// "describe a picture" box read as nonsense.
