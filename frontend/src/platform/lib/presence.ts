 *  Meanwhile window B's periodic heartbeat reads `{A, B}` — still, if this
 *  happens before A's write actually lands — updates its own entry's

// ---- canonical identity --------------------------------------------------

/** Defect 1 (live testing, 2026-09-17): `currentPresencePage()` used to
 *  return `currentUrl()` verbatim — pathname + query, exactly as the address
 *  bar would show it. That is fine for a route whose query is genuinely part
 *  of "which page is this" (a Preferences tab), but most query-bearing shell
 *  routes carry APP STATE, not identity: the Playground syncs its prompt and
 *  model into the query string on every keystroke-ish change, so two
 *  requests seconds apart from the SAME open tab produced two different
 *  `page`/`source` values. Two consequences, both observed live:
 *   - `familyKey` (`jobs.ts`) is `job.source || job.page`, so the two
 *     text-gen rows never shared a key and could never group.
 *   - `matchesSource` requires an exact match once either side carries a
 *     `?`, so the row's own `source` (captured when the request was made)
 *     almost never exact-matched the CURRENT presence page by the time the
 *     job finished — suppression silently never fired, which is very likely
 *     why popups kept appearing for a page the user never left.
 *
 *  THE RULE: a query-bearing string's identity is the string itself ONLY
 *  when it is a registered key in `ORIGIN_BY_ROUTE` — that table is already
 *  the closed set of "this exact route+query is its own distinct surface"
 *  (`/preferences?tab=indexing` beside bare `/preferences`, Fix 19).
 *  Everything else canonicalizes down to the bare path: a Playground prompt,
 *  a model id, `_side=claude`, a `session_id` are shell/app state, never
 *  identity, and dropping the query (and any hash) is what makes two
 *  requests from the same open tab collapse to the same value.
 *
 *  APPLIED IN ONE PLACE per consumer, not three: `currentPresencePage()`
 *  (below) canonicalizes what THIS document stamps into its own presence
 *  entry and what `api.ts`'s `ambientSourceHeaders()` sends as
 *  `X-Fused-Source` — the same value `familyKey` groups by once the server
 *  echoes it back as `Job.source`. `matchesSource` ALSO canonicalizes both
 *  of its arguments (not just trusts its callers to have already done so),
 *  because a `Job.source` already sitting in the store from before this fix
 *  shipped is exactly the "dirty" value this bug produced — canonicalizing
 *  at compare-time lets an old dirty row still match a freshly-canonical
 *  live presence page instead of being stuck matching a URL nobody will

 *    Once canonicalization (above) has reduced every OTHER query-bearing
 *    string down to its bare path, this is the only shape that can still
 *    reach here carrying a `?`, so the rule below still earns its keep: it
 *    stops that registered surface from cross-matching, or being
 *    prefix-matched against, the bare route it sits beside.
 *  - Everything else (a bare shell route, or an fs path) matches by prefix
 *    on a path boundary: an app folder counts as open when a window is
 *    showing anything nested under it (`/a/project` vs. a window on
 *    `/a/project/sub/file.py`), and the reverse also counts — a window
 *    sitting exactly on a sub-path still has the parent folder "open" for
