// The listing prefetch cache (api.ts's `listPrefetch`) and the one thing it has
// to do besides dedupe: FORGET what it knows the moment the filesystem changes.
//
// THE BUG THIS FILE EXISTS FOR — "a drag onto a breadcrumb copies the file".
// It never copied anything; the move was a real rename both times it was
// looked at. What the user saw was the SOURCE listing repainting from this
// cache after the move:
//
//   1. in /a/b/c, drag a file and hold the /a crumb — the spring-load navigates
//      to /a, which fills this cache with /a's listing AND unmounts the source
//      listing (killing its dir-watch, so nothing will ever tell /a/b/c that
//      the file left);
//   2. drop into /a/d — a real rename; the TARGET listing refetches with
//      refresh > 0, which bypasses the cache, so the destination is correct;
//   3. navigate back to /a/b/c within the 5s TTL — a FRESH MOUNT, so
//      useDirListing reads through this cache (refresh === 0) and paints the
//      PRE-MOVE listing. One file, visible in two folders, which reads as a
//      copy. It healed itself after 5s, hence "intermittent".
//
// So: any successful fs mutation must invalidate the whole map. These tests
// pin that, and the dedupe it must not lose.
