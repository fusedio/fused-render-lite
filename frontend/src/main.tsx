//
// It has to, because nothing else here can see those writes: they are fetches
// from inside the frame, which is its own JS realm with its own copy of lib/api,
// so this window's listing prefetch cache is untouched by them. The directory
// watcher is not a backstop either — it watches only the ONE folder a mounted
// listing is showing, and a template view of a FILE has no listing at all. The
// symptom was a view saving a file and a navigation to that folder seconds later
// painting the folder as it stood before the save.
//
// A global rather than a postMessage for the same reason the runtime reads params
// off ancestor URLs directly (D3/D4, D46) — same-origin by construction — and
// installed here, beside the history wrapping, because both are contracts with
// that runtime that must exist before any frame can load.
//
// Two effects, not one: `clearListPrefetch` protects a listing that mounts
// LATER (within the 5s TTL) from painting pre-write contents, but it cannot
// reach a listing that is ALREADY mounted — nothing pops its `refresh`
// counter. `notifyFsChanged` (listing/fsChangeBus.ts) is that missing half:
// every live `useDirListing` subscribes to it and re-fetches through the same
// 300ms debounce its own dir-watch socket uses. Without it, staging a file
// through the git template left an open Explorer pane showing what it had
// before the stage — the write never touched the watched directory's own
// mtime, so the socket-driven watch had nothing to notice either.
