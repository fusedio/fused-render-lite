// The comparison chart's Share button: draws the chart, this machine's
// hardware and the fused render mark into one PNG (`shareCard.ts`) and hands it
// to the OS share sheet, the clipboard, or a download — whichever the browser
// actually supports.
//
// It lives beside the chart's own heading rather than over the chart, because
// what it shares is the SECTION's current selection (capability + metric), not
// a hovered row — and it renders only when there is a chart to share, the same
// rule the chart itself follows: a Share button above "no runs recorded yet"
// offers to send an empty axis.
//
// **The outcome is SAID, not assumed — but through the global toast (D480),
// not an inline note beside the button.** An inline `<span>` here used to sit
// inside `.am-bench-share`, inside `.am-bench-headtools`, inside the
// right-aligned `.am-section-head` row — so the instant a receipt like "Copied
// as an image" appeared, the whole control group got pushed left (measured:
// the Metric `<select>`'s left edge jumped from x≈1183 to x≈962, ~220px) and
// the button the reader had just pressed moved out from under their pointer.
// It also landed next to the section's own `<h3>`, where a sentence reads as
// a second heading rather than a receipt for one click. A toast has neither
// problem: it renders in `NotificationHost` at the app root, entirely outside
// this row's layout, so nothing beside the button ever moves — and it is
// unambiguously a transient system message, not a second title. `notify()`
// already owns auto-dismiss (`lib/notifications.ts`'s JOB_POPUP_VISIBLE_MS
// popup window), so there is no local timer to keep in step with it here.

  // `notify()` call (D480), gating it on `alive` silently drops it in exactly

  // component while the PNG is still encoding, `alive.current` goes false,

  // at the app root), so it has nothing to protect against by waiting on
  // `alive` — only `setBusy` below, a real `useState` on THIS instance,
  // still needs the guard.

  // instance and its refs — this app does not run under StrictMode today, but
  // `TranscribeStage.tsx`'s `aliveRef` documents the identical hazard for
  // when it does) runs mount -> cleanup -> mount again with no render in
