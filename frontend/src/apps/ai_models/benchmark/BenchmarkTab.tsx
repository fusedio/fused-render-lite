// The Benchmark tab: one capability at a time, THREE instruments for it — a
// ranked comparison chart (the hero: "which of these is fastest here"), a
// leaderboard of every model with its own action (Run, Details), and a
// per-model trend chart (secondary: "is THIS model getting faster or
// slower"), now rendered INLINE directly under whichever row it belongs to
// (D481) rather than in its own block below the whole list — plus the
// archive underneath and a button to measure again (SPEC AI-14).
//
// **The question this tab exists to answer is "how fast is THIS model on THIS
// laptop", and the only way to answer it comparably is to fix the work.** So a
// run is not configurable: the server owns one frozen workload per capability
// (ai/benchmark.py) and this tab presses a button. That is the deliberate cost —
// a number exists only where somebody pressed it — and the deliberate gain: two
// models here, or one model across two app versions, are legitimately
// comparable, which the passive Usage tab's figures never are.
//
// **Comparison and trend are two DIFFERENT questions, and this tab has tried
// to answer them with one chart TWICE, wrong both times.** First attempt:
// every model as its own series on one shared timeline — with one or two runs
// per model that was a scatter of near-unlabelable dots, which is the real
// reason it needed edge-avoiding end labels and kept repeating one date three
// times. Second attempt, after splitting the trend out: make the LEADERBOARD's
// own inline mini-bar the whole comparison story and give the per-model trend
// chart the hero's spot. That one shipped and broke differently — the trend
// chart needs TWO RUNS OF THE SAME MODEL, and real usage spreads a handful of
// runs ACROSS several different models far more often than it re-runs one, so
// the trend chart's "single" state fired for nearly every model and the page
// had NO CHART AT ALL. `ComparisonChart` is the actual fix: a real, gridlined
// bar chart across every BENCHMARKED model, which renders whenever more than
// one model has a measurement — the normal case — and the leaderboard's own
// inline bar is deleted, since drawing the identical proportional comparison
// twice (once properly, with an axis, once as an unlabelled sliver in each
// row) was the duplicated ink. `ModelTrendChart` keeps its own spot,
// correctly secondary, for the model a reader picks by clicking a leaderboard
// row — see the D481 comment above `.am-bench-rows`' render loop for why that
// spot moved from a block below the whole list to right under the clicked
// row itself.
//
// THE LISTING IS NOT THIS TAB'S. `scan` arrives from the page above
// (lib/useCacheScan.ts) exactly as it does for the Local tab, because "which
// models could I benchmark" is the question that shared cache walk already
// answers, and a second crawl behind this tab is precisely the cost that hook
// exists to avoid.
//
// Three-state loading discipline throughout, the same one UsageTab and LocalTab
// follow: `null` is "not answered yet" and draws a skeleton, `[]` is "answered,
// and there is nothing", and a failure draws an ErrorBanner while KEEPING the
// last good value — a failed refresh must not blank a history somebody is
// reading.
//
// **A run holds its HTTP request open for minutes** (the server does this
// deliberately — see routers/ai_benchmark.py), so the click cannot be awaited
// as if it were a save. Only the pressed capability's buttons go dead; the rest
// of the page stays live.
//
// **A benchmark now opens its OWN download-manager row for the measurement
// phase, titled distinctly from the load's** (`ai/benchmark.py`'s
// `_MeasurementRow`/`_bench_job_title`) — the fourth design, after three that
// collided on TITLE. Server job rows are keyed by TITLE (`useCacheScan` maps
// `job.title -> job`) and `supervisor.load` already owns the row titled with
// the bare model id; a benchmark row sharing that title either could not be
// found or SHADOWED the load's, which put the manager's only ✕ on the load and
// let a cold run spin to its hour-long timeout. `_bench_job_title` fixes the
// title rather than removing the row, so through a COLD run the load's own row
// still shows up first, with real byte counts, and once loading ends this
// module's own row takes over — the phase that used to be total silence.
//
// **This tab's OWN busy row is a second, complementary view of the same run —
// phase plus a REAL elapsed clock, never an invented percentage** (see
// `busyRowText` in lib/benchmark.ts, and the ai-models.css comment near line
// 1282 for the house rule against invented bars). It reuses `lib/aiRuntime.ts`'s
// already-polled table rather than adding a second poll: while that table
// still reports the model loading, the row says so; once it does not, the row
// switches to "Measuring — mm:ss" ticking from the moment Run was pressed.

  // render rather than during it, since writing history is a side effect.
  //
  // **An explicit close is written VERBATIM (`modelParam === closedSentinel`
  // — THIS capability's own marker, never any other), not as
  // `selectedModel`** (which `resolveModel` resolves to `null` for exactly
  // this case): `writeParams` deletes a key given `null`, and a deleted
  // `?benchModel=` is indistinguishable from one that was never set, which
  // would make a closed row silently re-open itself on the next reload. Every
  // OTHER case — including a marker closed under a DIFFERENT capability,
  // left over in `modelParam` from before the reader switched — writes the
  // resolved `selectedModel` rather than echoing `modelParam` raw, which
  // doubles as the fix for the cross-capability leak: the stale foreign
  // marker gets overwritten with this capability's own real default the
  // very next time this effect runs, rather than lingering in the URL.
  //
  // **This hook must run on EVERY render, loading or not** — React throws
  // ("Rendered more hooks than during the previous render") the moment a hook
  // sits below a conditional return, because the loading render would then
  // call one fewer hook than the render after it. The `loading` guard

          name rather than borrowing a sibling `<select>`'s current value, the
          select's value changes on click, the heading should not blink with
          it.

          **The Metric select lives HERE now, not in the page-level toolbar
          above** — it changes what the comparison chart plots and what the
          leaderboard rows rank by, and both of those are inside this card;
          Capability (still in the toolbar) picks WHICH card, a page-level
          question. Hidden rather than disabled when there is nothing to pick
          from — a select with zero options renders as an empty,
          clickable-looking box, and there is nothing honest for it to say.

          **The unit and the direction cue are IN the option text**
          (`metricOptionLabel`, lib/benchmark.ts — "Speed (× realtime)", "Peak
          memory (lower is better)"), not in a badge beside the select. Two
          badges have now been tried and both failed on the same axis. Trailing
          the select it was a third mark in a row that already holds an `<h3>`
          and a Share button, saying nothing the control it followed could not
          say itself. Moved to the LEFT of the select — where the "Metric"
          caption used to be, so the row would read unit-then-choice — it broke
          outright on transcription: `× realtime` is a multiplier SUFFIX, it
          parses only when it trails a number ("1.4× realtime"), and alone in a
          bordered pill beside a control it read as the dismiss ✕ of a
          removable filter chip — a shape this app uses elsewhere for exactly
          that (D448's Tasks filter pills). Inside the option the words have a
          subject again, the empty-unit metric (`Peak memory` formats through
          the byte formatter and has no unit string, so the pill there held
          only "lower is better") stops being a special case, and the fact is
          stated where the choice is made rather than beside it.

          The CUE is one-sided on purpose: "lower is better" for exactly the
          metrics where the ordinary "longer bar / bigger number wins" habit
          reads backwards (Peak memory, Load time, …), nothing extra for the
          metrics where that habit already reads right — labelling both
          directions everywhere would bury the one case actually worth
          flagging. Read by both instruments below (the comparison chart's
          shorter-is-better bars and the trend chart's downward-is-better line
          invert the same way), and still said only once: the old
          per-model-name-plus-unit pill on the trend heading below is GONE
          too. */}

              TWO RUNS OF THE SAME MODEL, and real usage spreads a handful of
              runs across several different models far more often than it
              re-runs one, so the trend chart's "single" state fired for
              nearly every model and the page had no chart at all. Failed and
              never-benchmarked models have nothing to plot (`comparisonBars`
              excludes them) but stay fully visible in the rows below, which
              is where their action — Run, Details — lives anyway. */}

              after another, reusing the exact same `start()` a single "Run"
              press does (`BenchmarkTab`'s `runAllFor`), so a queued run and a
              manual one are indistinguishable to the server and to the
              history. Sits between the two chart instruments and the ledger
              rows it drives, since it acts on exactly that list — and now
              (D479) sits FLUSH against those rows in the markup's own order
              (see `.am-bench-runall + .am-bench-rows` in ai-models.css): the
              button is that list's control, not a third, orphaned instrument
              floating in the gap the chart and the rows each already own a
              margin into.

              **The label states the true cost up front** — "Run all 6
              models" — rather than reading like a single cheap click; each
              one is a COLD load (the benchmark unloads whatever it loaded),
              so six Whisper models is many minutes and several GB of
              repeated downloads-from-disk. `runnable.length === 0` hides the
              button entirely rather than disabling it — there is nothing
              honest for a Run All button to say when every model is
              already `gone`.

              **Idle branch is `--fg`-outlined, glyph-led, plain text (D479)**
              — not the accent outline `.am-card-try` wears on the Models tab,
              and not a filled plate. Accent on THIS tab is already spoken
              for as DATA ink: the comparison chart's bars, the metric values
              in each row, and the selected row's ring all draw in it, so an
              accent-outlined button sitting between the chart and the
              selection would read as one more lime thing competing to be the
              current selection rather than a control. `--fg` says "control",
              not "selected" or "value", and stays true everywhere on the
              page. A filled plate was rejected on the D475 precedent this
              tab does not get to except itself from: filled is the loudest
              mark this page can make, reserved for the ONE genuinely
              consequential action beside a cheaper one (Load, filled, next
              to Try, outlined, on the Models tab) — and Run All is minutes
              of compute across N cold loads and several GB re-read from
              disk, the single most expensive thing a press can start here.
              It should be findable, which the border and full-opacity text
              do; it should not be the loudest thing on the page competing
              with the chart above it. The glyph is `MenuIcons.play`, the
              exact triangle every row below already wears on its own Run
              button — "run all" is that same act N times over, so it borrows
              the row's own vocabulary instead of inventing a second one; a
              bare word here would say the same thing in a different
              language than the list it operates on. */}

              **The WHOLE ROW is the accordion header** ("let's make the
              entire row have a dropdown of sorts") — clicking anywhere on
              it except the Run button, or Enter/Space on its one focusable
              disclosure control (the model-name cell, `BenchmarkRow`),
              TOGGLES it: an already-open row closes, any other opens (and
              closes whichever row was open before it — exactly one at a
              time). Open is the one full-width expansion rendered as that
              row's sibling in `.am-bench-rows`, holding BOTH the per-run
              detail/failure text and INSTRUMENT THREE, the trend, for
              `selectedModel` — and visually FUSED to its row into one card
              that grew (ai-models.css: the open row's own bottom corners
              square off and its bottom border drops, the expansion picks
              up the matching side/bottom border and radius and the same
              accent wash, so there is no seam between "the header" and
              "the part that opened").

              **One row, one open state, one hit target — three passes to
              get here.** Pass one put the trend behind a SEPARATE
              `<details>` beside a plain-select row — two independent
              expanders on one row. Pass two merged them into a single
              `<button>` chevron with `aria-expanded`, but selection was
              still a plain assignment with no way back to closed — a
              control reporting `aria-expanded="true"` that cannot collapse.
              Pass two-and-a-half fixed closing (an explicit `""` in
              `?benchModel=`, `resolveModel`/lib/benchmark.ts, distinct from
              `null`'s "no opinion yet, pick the default" — survives a
              reload instead of the closed row silently reopening) but left
              the 16px chevron glyph as the ONLY thing on a 36px-tall row
              that actually opened it, with the row's own click doing the
              same job right beside it with no visual hint that it did.
              This pass fixes THAT: the chevron is now a plain, `aria-
              hidden` rotation indicator with no handler or focus stop of
              its own, the row itself carries the click (bubbling from
              anywhere inside it, Run excepted — see its own comment), and
              the model-name cell is the row's one real focusable control,
              carrying `aria-expanded`/`aria-controls` so there is exactly
              one place that contract lives and exactly one extra Tab stop
              per row (that cell, then Run) instead of three. A row with
              nothing to expand (`row === null`, never benchmarked) gets
              none of this — no chevron, no hand cursor, no `aria-expanded`,
              a click that does nothing (`BenchmarkRow`'s `expandable`). At
              N models the trend's original position (a block below the
              WHOLE list) put row N's click a full screen away from the
              thing it changed; the sibling-of-the-row position fixed that,
              and each later pass fixed a way the fix itself still fell
              short of "click the thing, see the thing change, right
              there". One more since: the `""` mentioned above was a BARE
              flag, and `modelParam` is one piece of state shared across
              every capability — closing a row under one capability left
              every OTHER capability's `?benchModel=` reading as "closed"
              too the instant the reader switched to it. The sentinel now
              carries the capability it was closed under
              (`closedModelSentinel`, lib/benchmark.ts) so a marker closed
              elsewhere fails the equality check here and falls through to
              this capability's own default instead. */}
