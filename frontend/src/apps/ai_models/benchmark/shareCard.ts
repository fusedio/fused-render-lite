// The SHARE CARD: the comparison chart, this machine's hardware, and the
// fused render mark, redrawn as one self-contained PNG (SPEC AI-14).
//
// A benchmark number is only meaningful WITH the machine that produced it, so
// the hardware block is not decoration here — it is the caption without which
// the chart is unshareable. "62 tok/s" pasted into a chat says nothing; "62
// tok/s, macOS arm64, 12 cores, 32 GB, mps" is a result somebody else can
// compare against.
//
// **Drawn on a canvas from the same data the chart has, NOT rasterized from the
// DOM.** The two DOM routes both fail here: `html2canvas`-style serialization
// would need the app's whole cascade re-resolved into inline styles (the chart
// is CSS flex + percentage widths — see ComparisonChart.tsx), and
// SVG-foreignObject rasterization silently drops anything it cannot fetch,
// which is the same reliably-blank failure `platform/lib/appShot.ts` documents
// for the export path. Tab capture (appShot's answer) is wrong for a different
// reason: it needs the browser's share prompt, photographs the surrounding
// page chrome, and cannot include a hardware caption that is not on screen.
// The chart's inputs are `bars` + `metric` + `machine` — a few dozen numbers —
// so redrawing them is both exact and cheap.
//
// **The card is always DARK, whatever theme the app is in.** It is a poster,
// not a screenshot: every shared card should look like the same artefact, and
// the lime mark reads as branding on dark and as a highlighter stain on white.
// That is why the palette below is literal hex rather than a `getComputedStyle`
// read of the app's tokens — the values are the dark palette's own
// (styles/tokens.css), copied deliberately, because a canvas cannot reference a
// CSS variable and a theme-following card would ship two different brands.
