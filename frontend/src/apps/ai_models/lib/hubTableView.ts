// One row per hit's cell values, as pure derivations — read by

// design, so the part with a rule in it lives in a module that can be
// driven.
//
// **Every cell whose source can be absent renders a dash, and that is the
// whole discipline this module exists to enforce.** A wrong number is a
// louder mistake than a dash — the plan's own example is llmfit's `search`
// table, whose Score/tok/s/Runtime/Mode/Mem% columns are filled entirely
// with `-` because nothing there ever distinguished "we do not know" from
// "the answer is zero". This module never renders `0` for something merely
// unmeasured.
//
// The family/hoist/dense-table half of this module (`hoistValue`,
// `familyHoist`, `occupiedColumns`, `speedLabel`, `familyDisplay`,
// `capabilityHint`, and friends) was deleted alongside `HubResultsTable.tsx`
// and `hubFamilies.ts`: the two-pane port's search screen (`HubSearchScreen`)
// draws one row per repo with no family grouping and no dense `<table>`, so
// there is nothing left to hoist a column out of or collapse a family into.

// server-computed) that blends memory fit with capability, speed, recency
// and popularity. The cell prints that composite as a single number, coloured
// by the memory verdict — the two facts stay distinct (a number's magnitude
// and its colour can disagree, and that disagreement is itself informative:
// a red 76 ranks well on everything except this machine's memory) without
// needing two separate marks to carry them.
