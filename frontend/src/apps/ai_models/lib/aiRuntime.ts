// sidebar entry's dot (SPEC §40).
//
// Two readers, one poll. The sidebar needs a single bit — is anything loaded —
// and the page needs the whole table; polling twice would be two requests a
// second for one in-memory answer, and worse, they would disagree for a beat
// after a load or an unload. So the poll lives here and both subscribe: one
// module-level record, a listener set, and a `publish` that writes both — which
// is also what lets a load STARTED on the page reach a sidebar that never
// polled for it.
//
// The cadence follows the state, not the clock: while something is loading or
// downloading the numbers move every second, and while nothing is happening
// there is nothing to see. An idle machine costs one cheap in-memory read every
// 10 seconds.
