// The "Run all" queue: sequencing, stop semantics, and the success/failure
// tally for benchmarking every model in a capability one after another
// (SPEC AI-14 follow-up). Pure state here, no network calls — `BenchmarkTab.tsx`
// drives the actual `runAiBenchmark` request per model and feeds each outcome
// back in through `advanceQueue`, exactly the way `runButtonState`
// (benchmark.ts) stays a pure decision function beside the component that
// acts on it.
//
// **Sequential by construction, not by a lock.** There is no "is something
// running" flag to check before starting the next model — `advanceQueue` is
// only ever called with the PREVIOUS model's settled result, so the caller
// physically cannot ask for the next model before the current one finishes.
// This also happens to be exactly what the server's own one-resident-model-
// per-capability rule requires (a second concurrent run on the same
// capability is a 409) — the queue satisfies that constraint by construction
// rather than by racing it.
//
// **A failure does not stop the queue.** `advanceQueue` records whatever
// result it is given — `ok: true` or `ok: false` — and moves on regardless;
// only `requestQueueStop` (a deliberate user action) or reaching the end of
// `models` stops it. A model failing is a real fact about this machine
// (`ai/benchmark.py` already records it as a normal, non-cancelled run) and
// stopping a six-model queue because the second one OOM'd would throw away
// five perfectly good measurements over one bad one.
//
// **Stop only prevents the NEXT model from starting — it does not reach
// into an in-flight request.** `requestQueueStop` just sets `stopped`; the
// caller is responsible for ALSO interrupting the current run through
// `cancelAiGeneration` (`POST /api/ai/cancel`, wired into BenchmarkTab.tsx's
// `stopAllFor`) — the cooperative channel `ai/supervisor.py`'s
// `cancel_generation` exposes, which asks the resident worker to set its own
// `cancelled` flag rather than tearing the process down. (An earlier version
// of this comment, and of `stopAllFor`, called `unloadAiModel` for this —
// that was wrong: unloading terminates the worker PROCESS, which drops the
// held-open request's connection instead of resolving it with a clean
// `cancelled: true`, and `ai/benchmark.py`'s `run()` recorded the resulting
// socket error as an ordinary `ok:false` failure — a permanent history row
// for a run somebody stopped on purpose.) This module deliberately does not
// invent a second cancellation idiom; it only has to make sure that once the
// interrupted (or naturally finished) run settles, `advanceQueue` sees
// `stopped` and goes no further.

 *  set from a Stop button's `onClick`, via `setQueues`) can call
 *  `requestQueueStop` as many times as it likes: the loop's own `queue`
 *  variable never reads that state back, so `advanceQueue` keeps seeing
 *  `stopped: false` forever and starts every remaining model anyway. Every
 *  test in this file passed while that shipped, because a test reassigns
 *  `q = requestQueueStop(q)` onto the SAME variable `advanceQueue` reads next
 *  — the pure logic was never wrong, only how the component wired it.
 *
 *  The fix is for the caller to track the queue in something a loop CAN read
 *  mid-flight — a ref, not a `useState` closure — and merge whatever
 *  `stopped` it observes there onto the queue it is about to advance:
 *
