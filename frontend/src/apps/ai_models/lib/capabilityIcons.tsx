// One glyph per capability, shared by every AI Models surface that draws one
// (D428; moved here from playground/capabilityIcons.tsx in fix round 3 item
// 13 so the Local tab's nav could reuse the exact same components the
// Playground sidebar draws, instead of the separate 24-viewBox string-SVG set
// `capabilityMeta.ts` used to keep for itself — see that file for how it now
// composes these with `PARTS_ICON`, the one nav row ("Engine files") that has
// no Playground counterpart and so is not in this map).
//
// Lives in `lib/`, next to `engines.ts`'s `capabilityLabel()` (same
// directory, same capability-tag keys) rather than inside `engines.ts`
// itself: `engines.ts` is on `playground/groups.ts`'s import graph, and
// `groups.ts` is what Home imports eagerly — JSX here would drag React
// markup into the front-door bundle, the exact pull this file was kept
// separate to avoid before the move. Neither `groups.ts` nor `engines.ts`
// imports this file; only components that already render JSX do
// (`PlaygroundTab.tsx`, `controls.tsx`, `capabilityMeta.tsx`).
//
// Same grammar as platform/ui/MenuIcons: 16px on a 0 0 24 24 viewBox,
// stroke-only, currentColor, strokeWidth 1.5 — so the glyphs sit beside the
// app's other icons without a weight argument.
