// problem: a 2.4GB repo a runner fetched for itself lands fifth, between two
// models the user chose, and the only thing distinguishing it is the quietest
// element on the card. Position carried no meaning at all. What decides a
// bucket is a two-field question over `component` and `capability`, it has a
// wrong answer that looks right (see `UNRECOGNISED`), and none of that is
// visible in a screenshot — so it lives here as plain functions, with
// `aiModelGroups.test.ts` driving them.
//
// Client side by decision: every field this reads is already in the payload,
// and a `group` field on the response would be the server deciding a layout
// question for one page.

/** The reading order for the capabilities this app actually serves.
 *
 *  Hardcoded, and only for ORDER — every label still comes from
 *  `capabilityLabel`, so there is one place where a capability is put into
 *  words.
 *
 *  **ONE list, read by all three tabs — Playground, Models, Benchmark —**
 *  and no tab keeps a private copy (D475): each used to disagree about
 *  where a capability landed, and the page they added up to put the same
 *  five sections in two (then three) orders, so a reader moving between
 *  tabs had to re-find every one. This is still true after the reorder
 *  below — the fix was never about WHICH order won, only that there is
 *  exactly one.
 *
 *  **TEXT GENERATION LEADS** (D807), swapped back above image generation to
 *  match the AI Models two-pane mockup's reading order, which the Local tab's
 *  redesign must follow exactly. This reverses the 2026-08-25 promotion of
 *  image generation (argued there on the strength of a picture being the more
 *  legible demonstration); the two are a judgement call about the first
 *  impression, not a fact one of them got wrong — this round it is settled by
 *  the approved mockup, not re-litigated on its own merits.
 *
 *  It changes what Playground opens on by default, which capability's card
 *  is first on the Models tab, and which section the Benchmark tab draws
 *  first — deliberately, since keeping one shared list (rather than
 *  reintroducing a per-tab order) is the entire point D475 already settled;
 *  a change here is a change everywhere on purpose. Home's own strip is a
 *  SECOND array (`PLAYGROUND_GROUPS`, playground/groups.ts) carrying blurbs
 *  this list has no room for, and it is ordered to match by hand — the two
 *  have to be edited together or the front door and the tab disagree.
 *  Everything else keeps its relative order (speech, then embeddings, then
 *  video) — this is a swap of the top two, not a fresh ranking of all five.
 *
 *  VIDEO IS LISTED, deliberately, rather than left to fall through to the
 *  end by accident (its own history, from when the Playground had no
 *  private copy naming it at all) — it sorts last of the five named here,
 *  which is where it has always ended up, now on purpose.
 *
 *  A capability missing from this list is still not missing from the page: it
 *  sorts after these, in the order the server sent it (see `groupRepos`), which
 *  is how a capability added server-side shows up without a frontend change.
 *
 *  **Exported for the Benchmark and Playground tabs**, which draw one section
 *  per capability and have to draw them in the same order this one does — a
 *  page whose three tabs disagree about where Embeddings goes reads as three
 *  pages. Imported there rather than re-declared, because two copies of a

/** The Local tab's capability rows: disk and curation in one order.
 *
 *  **A capability with nothing on disk still gets a row when something is
 *  recommended for it**, and that is the whole point of merging rather than
 *  stacking two grids. A fresh machine's Local tab used to be one sentence and a
 *  button to another tab; now the answer to "what should I get" is drawn where
 *  the answer to "what do I have" will appear, in the same row, so the page
 *  fills up in place instead of switching views.
 *
 *  Recommended entries are the CURATED half only, minus anything that already
 *  has a card — `diskCards`, the page's own walk and not the catalog's
 *  `downloaded` flag: two definitions of "downloaded" on one page are two
 *  moments they were true, and this page has cards drawn from both halves side
 *  by side. Note that the filter is "has a card", not "is downloaded": a partly
 *  downloaded repo is neither, and it keeps its card and its own Download rather
 *  than being recommended a second time beside itself (D424). While the walk has
 *  not answered (`onDisk === null`) nothing is recommended at all — the same
 *  posture the download cards take, since a recommendation is a claim that this
 *  machine does not have the model.
 *
 *  **The lookup is by `repo`, not by `id`, and that is what makes the filter
 *  able to fire at all for llama.cpp.** Those curated ids are bare GGUF
 *  FILENAMES (`AiCatalogModel.repo` says why), and `diskCards` is keyed by REPO
 *  id — so `LFM2.5-1.2B-Instruct-Q4_K_M.gguf` never matched
 *  `LiquidAI/LFM2.5-1.2B-Instruct-GGUF`, and every downloaded GGUF suggestion
 *  stayed recommended forever, wearing a Download button next to the finished
 *  disk card its own bytes had made. Pressing it re-ran a download that
 *  completed instantly with nothing left to fetch and changed nothing on
 *  screen, which is indistinguishable from a download that does not work. This
 *  is the same duplicate the server already drops from its "cached" tail
 *  (`curated_repo_ids`, ai_runtime.py) — resolved here through the identity it
 *  puts on the wire for exactly this, rather than through a second copy of
 *  `GGUF_RECIPES` in TypeScript.
 *
 *  Client side for the reason `groupRepos` above is: which rows sit in which
 *  order is a question about this page's layout, and every field it reads is
 *  already in two payloads the page has.
