// What the Local page's SEARCH FACE is showing, decided in one place.
//
// The page has two mutually exclusive faces — its own sections (a carousel per
// capability, then "Fetched by engines") and one grid of Hub search results —
// and three pieces of chrome that have to agree about which one is on screen:
// the grid itself, the "searching huggingface.co" caption that discloses the
// outbound request, and the control that goes BACK. Written inline they were
// separate `&&`s over the same condition, which is one chance per condition to
// leave one behind: a missing way back is a page with no exit.
//
// This module is `discoverView.ts` retargeted (D426). It was written for a
// Discover TAB whose two faces were a curated shortlist and these same results;
// that tab is gone and the search is a face of the Local page now, so what the
// idle face is CALLED is no longer this module's business — the page's own
// sections name themselves. What survives unchanged is the rule that made the
// swap legible, because it is the same swap.
//
// Here rather than in the component for the reason `engines.ts` is: the
// component cannot be unit-tested in this repo (there is no DOM harness, by
// design — every test here drives a pure module), and this is the part with a
// rule in it. The JSX that consumes it is three ternaries.
//
// It also owns the two MENUS' vocabulary and the one sort that the Hub cannot
// perform — see `ResultSort` — for the same reason: a page-level sort whose
// whole safety property is "this value never reaches the wire" is a rule, and a
// rule belongs somewhere it can be driven.

 *  search nobody typed. The COUNT is absent while the request is in flight:
 *  a "0 on huggingface.co" standing over an empty grid is a wrong answer where
 *  silence is a missing one.
 *
 *  `failed` is the same rule for the same reason, and it is a REQUIRED argument
 *  rather than an optional one because a summary that guessed would state the
 *  wrong fact silently. A search that did not come back has no count to report:
 *  a soft failure answers 200 with an `error` and `models: []`, which as a
 *  length is "0 on huggingface.co" — the heading saying the Hub HAS none of
 *  these, next to a banner saying we never heard back. A hard rejection is
 *  worse still, leaving the previous search's rows in state so the count comes
 *  from a different question entirely. What was ASKED survives a failure and is
