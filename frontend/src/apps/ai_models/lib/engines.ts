// What the Inference engines tab SAYS, separated from what it draws (D302).
//
// The tab is the Engines tab of /ai-models (shell/AiModelsEngines.tsx); it was
// a Preferences tab when this module was written, and the move is exactly what
// this split made cheap — the page that draws these sentences changed and not
// one of them did. What the move added is `switchOutcome` at the bottom: a
// switch used to be two navigations from anything it affected, and is now a tab
// click from all of it, so the page has to know when a switch changed
// something. Still a plain function over the payload, still driven by
// `engines.test.ts`.
//
// The rendering is four lines of JSX; the sentences are where this feature can
// actually be wrong, and they are wrong in ways a screenshot does not reveal —
// a preference reported as in force when it is not, an option greyed out with
// no reason in it, a capability with no engine that reads as a bug rather
// than as an unsupported machine. So the wording lives here, as plain
// functions over the server's payload, and `engines.test.ts` drives them.
//
// Nothing here invents copy about a MACHINE. Availability reasons ("needs
// Apple Silicon (this is windows/amd64)") come from the registry and are
// passed through untouched: the page cannot know them, and a second copy
// would drift from the one the AI Models page shows.

/** The stored engine code when NO option in the list matches it — else null.
 *
 *  A `<select value={x}>` whose options contain no `x` does not fall back to
 *  the first option: the DOM ignores the assignment, `selectedIndex` becomes -1,
 *  and the control renders EMPTY. So a stored preference naming an engine this
 *  build no longer registers turns the picker blank — the user sees a control
 *  with nothing in it, on a page whose whole job is saying which engine is in
 *  force. `ignoredWarning` already prints the reason underneath, which makes the
 *  blank control worse rather than better: a sentence explaining a choice, above
 *  a control showing no choice.
 *
 *  **TWO different stored values land here, and the caller's copy has to be true
 *  of both.** `describe_engines` builds `choices` filtered by
 *  `runner.capability == capability`, so a stored code goes missing from the list
 *  for either of two reasons `resolve()` tells apart in prose but this function
 *  cannot see:
 *
 *    - the code is not registered at all — a preference written by a newer build,
 *      or naming an engine since withdrawn (D416 removed the three
 *      `transformers-text*` codes, which were offered in this very picker and
 *      stored by people who chose them);
 *    - the code IS registered and serves a DIFFERENT capability — a hand-edited
 *      or stale prefs.json, e.g. `{"text-generation": "mlx-whisper"}`.
 *      `prefs._valid_engine_choice` refuses that on write but says nothing about
 *      a file already on disk, which is the same reachability argument that
 *      justifies handling the withdrawn case at all.
 *
 *  So this returns "the stored code matches no option", and NOT "the engine is
 *  gone" — the caller must not claim a withdrawal it cannot establish. Telling
 *  the two apart needs `registry.by_code`, which lives on the server and is not
 *  on this payload; the DISTINCTION is already carried by `ignoredReason`, which
 *  `ignoredWarning` prints verbatim underneath ("… is not a runner this build
 *  knows" against "MLX Whisper does not do text-generation"). That split is
 *  deliberate: the specific reason is the registry's sentence to write, and this
 *  module does not paraphrase those.
 *
 *  Either way `prefs.json` is a file that travels — synced, copied, restored
 *  from a backup — so an upgrade is not the only way one arrives, and the server
 *  deliberately does NOT rewrite `selected` to match reality (a preference
 *  silently corrected on read is one the user can neither see nor undo, see
 *  `describe_engines`). That is the right call, and it is exactly what leaves
 *  this case for the page to render.
 *
 *  The caller renders the returned code as one extra DISABLED option, so the
 *  picker shows what is stored, cannot be re-picked, and reads consistently
 *  with the warning below it — labelled with `row.strandedLabel` when the
 *  registry has one to give (a wrong-capability code) and the bare code
 *  itself when it does not (a withdrawn one has no runner left to name).
 *  This function returns only the CODE — the value the control keys
 *  `EngineSelect`'s stranded option on — because that is the one fact it can
 *  establish from the payload alone; the display name is `strandedLabel`'s
 *  job precisely because telling "withdrawn" from "wrong capability" needs
 *  `registry.by_code`, which lives on the server.
 *
 *  Null for `auto` — the caller renders that option itself, unconditionally.
