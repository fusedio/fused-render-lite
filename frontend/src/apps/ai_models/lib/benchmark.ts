// The rendering is a table, a row of numbers and a polyline. The places this
// feature can actually be WRONG are all in here, and none of them is visible in
// a screenshot:
//
//   * **Which number is the primary one, and which way is better.** Three of
//     the four capabilities are "bigger is faster"; image generation reports
//     seconds per step, where bigger is slower. A shared "up is green" rule
//     would state the opposite of the truth on one section in four.
//   * **null vs 0.** The server's standing rule is that a metric it did not
//     measure is null, never zero (ai/benchmark.py). A renderer doing
//     `value || "—"` turns a genuine 0 into a dash; one doing `value ?? 0`
//     turns "this runner does not report tokens" into "this model generated
//     nothing". Both look fine until the day a number matters.
//   * **The workload-revision seam.** Runs measured under different revisions
//     of a workload are not comparable, so a delta across one would be a
//     fabricated regression. `latestByModel` refuses to draw it.
//
// Nothing here invents a label or a byte formatter: capability names come from
// `capabilityLabel`, sizes from `formatSize`, and the section order from the
// Local tab's own `CAPABILITY_ORDER`. A second copy of any of those is how one
// page comes to disagree with itself.
