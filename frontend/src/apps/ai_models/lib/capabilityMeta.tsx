// Capability copy for the Local tab's two-pane layout.
//
// `plain` used to carry its own friendly register, distinct from
// `engines.ts`'s `CAPABILITY_LABELS` ("Text generation") — the mockup's own
// `CAPS` array copied verbatim ("Chat & writing" etc). Fix round 3 item 11
// retires that: the user asked for the standard capability names ("the
// standard capability names like text generation etc") everywhere a
// capability is named — nav, pane heading, the "← Back to …" link, the
// Task filter's own menu value (`hubSearchView.ts`'s `activeTask`), and the
// drawer's "Why we suggest it" sentence, which all read `plain` (directly or
// via `CapabilityPane`'s lower-cased `paneLabel`) rather than
// `capabilityLabel` — so the one place to make them agree is this table.
// `plain` is now `capabilityLabel(key)` itself; blurb and searchNoun keep
// their own plain-language register unchanged, since neither was named in
// that ask.
//
// Keyed off `CAPABILITY_ORDER`'s five capability tags (see
// `aiModelGroups.ts`) rather than re-deriving a list, so a capability added
// server-side still renders (falling back to `capabilityLabel` and a blank
// blurb) instead of vanishing from the nav column.
//
// Fix round 3 item 13: `icon` used to be this file's own 24-viewBox
// string-SVG set, rendered via `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` — a second drawing
// of every glyph the Playground sidebar already had its own component for
// (`lib/capabilityIcons.tsx`). The Local nav and the Playground rail are one
// click apart; a reader who has just picked "Text generation" in one should
// see the same mark for it in the other. `icon` is now a `ReactNode`, filled
// with `capabilityIcon(<tag>)` from that shared module for the five
// capabilities it covers — the same component, not a lookalike copy.
