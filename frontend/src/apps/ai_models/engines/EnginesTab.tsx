// The Engines tab of /ai-models (SPEC §40, D302) — which local-model backend
// serves each capability.
//
// **It lived on Preferences, and moving it is the point of this module.** The
// setting is about MODELS, and every consequence of changing it is on this
// page: which cards can be loaded, what their engine tags say, and what the
// Local tab recommends. On the settings page a user had to know that "Inference
// engines" was the answer to "why can't I load this?" — a question they were
// asking with the unloadable card in front of them, two navigations away from
// the control. Here the control and its consequences are one page apart by a
// tab click, and every sentence that used to read "switch it in Preferences →
// Inference engines" now points at a tab beside the one you are on.
//
// A TAB rather than a panel above the listing: it is a settings surface, and
// stacking it on top of the grid would put a second heading hierarchy in front
// of the section headings the Local tab just gained.
//
// The rendering is four lines of JSX per row; the SENTENCES are where this can
// be wrong, and they live in `@apps/ai_models/lib/engines` with `engines.test.ts` driving
// them. Not one of them changed in the move. What the move DID add there is
// `switchOutcome`: on Preferences the consequences of a switch were on another
// page and arriving here refetched them, and now they are the tab next door.
//
// **The `.prefs-*` classes did NOT survive the move, and the argument for
// keeping them did not survive contact with the rendered page.** It was that a
// switch which unloads a model should not look like one more thing on an
// inventory page. What it produced was three bare native `<select>`s adrift on
// an empty page, each under a heading and beside a repeated "Engine" label,
// with its resolved status stranded on a line below — a form somebody forgot to
// lay out, in an app where the two tabs beside it are made of cards. The
// setting is not made less consequential by sharing the page's vocabulary; it
// is made findable. One card per capability, one row inside it: the name, the
// control, the reality.

// One capability's engine: a listbox (`EngineSelect`) holding Automatic and

//
// A dropdown rather than a radio list, so that a machine with three engines for
// one capability is one line high instead of four — and so this reads like
// every other choice-of-several in this app's settings, which are all selects.
//
// **This used to be a native `<select>`, and the reason it is not any more is
// entirely about what an `<option>` can render.** The reason an unavailable
// engine cannot be picked used to be folded into its own option's plain-text
// label — "MLX Whisper (Apple Silicon) — needs Apple Silicon (this is
// windows/amd64)" — because a disabled `<option>` has nowhere else to say
// anything and its `title` is not reliably shown at all. A registry sentence
// is not always that short ("Diffusers (CUDA) — needs an NVIDIA GPU with its
// driver loaded — there is no /dev/nvidiactl or /dev/nvidia0 on this machine
// (this is linux/x86_64)"), and a native menu neither wraps nor styles that
// text — it just clips it. `EngineSelect` is a listbox built for exactly this:
// each option is up to two lines, a label and a muted wrapped description, so
// the reason reads as a sentence instead of a truncated run-on.
//
// Unavailable engines stay in the menu, disabled. Hidden, a Windows user would
// have no way to learn that the MLX path exists and why it is not for them —
// and a stored preference for one is what the control still SHOWS as its
// value (the trigger's own label), because "your choice, and why it is not in
// force" is exactly what the muted lines underneath go on to explain. It is
// the same rule the cards on the Local tab follow for their own controls:
// disabled and explained, never absent.
