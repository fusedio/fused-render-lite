// The /ai-models URL space: one path per tab, no query-string tab.
//
//   /ai-models/playground   (the default — bare /ai-models redirects here)
//   /ai-models/local
//   /ai-models/benchmark
//   /ai-models/engines
//   /ai-models/usage
//
// **There is no /ai-models/discover and no discover/ directory left** — the
// Local tab answers both halves of what that tab was for. Its RECOMMENDATIONS
// moved first (D423): each capability's row ends in the curation's picks with a
// Download button, so "what should I get" is drawn where "what do I have"
// appears, and a tab whose whole content is a second, emptier version of that is
// a strip entry that costs a reader a click to learn nothing. Its SEARCH moved
// after (D426): the box sits at the top of the Local tab, and a query replaces
// that tab's sections with one grid of Hub results (local/HubResults.tsx). The
// tab was left unrouted in between as a parking lot for code that had real tests
// and nowhere yet to live; there is nothing left in it to park.
//
// `/ai-models/discover` therefore falls out of `AI_MODELS_TABS` below as an
// unknown sub-path, and lands on the default like any other stale link.
//
// It used to be `?tab=`, with the default expressed as the ABSENCE of the
// param so that `/ai-models` stayed the page's URL. That is the trade this
// replaces: a tab is a PAGE here — five unrelated surfaces at the time (a chat
// client, a disk inventory, a Hub search, an engine picker, a usage graph) that
// shared only a heading — and naming four of them in a query string while the
// fifth had no name at all made the page's own address ambiguous. Bare
// `/ai-models` now redirects (App.tsx, the same render-time `replaceState`
// the shell uses for `/` → `/home`), so every tab has exactly one address and
// the default has a name like the rest.
//
// **The tabs still do not each get their own React route.** One `AiModelsPage`
// stays mounted across a tab switch, unkeyed by the nav epoch — see the branch
// in App.tsx for why (a remount re-walks every blob in the Hugging Face cache
// and throws away whatever was typed into the Local tab's search). What changed
// is where the choice is WRITTEN, not how it is rendered.
//
// **Query params survive the move and mean what they always did.** `?model=`
// and `?cap=` seed the playground's picker (Home's cards link in with `cap`,
// a Local card's "Try" with `model`), and each stage's non-default settings
// ride along beside them. Only the tab left the query string.
//
// NO LEGACY REWRITE. `/ai-models?tab=local` does not map to
// `/ai-models/local` — an unknown sub-path falls back to the default tab
// (`tabFromPath` below), so a stale link opens the page on the playground
// rather than erroring, and that is the whole of the migration. Owner's call:
// the shape is days old and not worth a permanent alias in `router.ts`.
