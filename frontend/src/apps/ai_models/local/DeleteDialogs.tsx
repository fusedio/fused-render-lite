// The delete confirmation, and nothing else.
//
// It is the only surface on this page that DESTROYS something, and it is the
// reason the flow has a `Pending` state at all: no click goes straight to a
// delete, every one becomes a target the user reads back first. It states the
// bytes it frees, because that number is the whole reason someone is here.
//
// There was a SECOND dialog here, for deleting one revision of a repo, and it
// went with the revision UI on 2026-08-24 (see `RepoCard`'s headstone). It was
// the most carefully written dialog on the page — it stated the blobs a
// revision shares with its siblings and therefore does NOT free — and none of
// that was a question anyone brought to this page: it asked a reader to pick a
// git commit off a folder whose only real question is what it costs. The whole
// repo is the target now, which is the number the card shows.
//
// Split out of the page file so the Local tab reads as its grid plus a dialog
// prop, rather than as a grid with 90 lines of modal markup hanging off the
// bottom of the same component.
