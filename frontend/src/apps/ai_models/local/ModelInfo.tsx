// The (i) in a card's head, and the panel it opens: everything about a model
// that is IDENTITY rather than STATE.
//
// The card's face used to carry all of it — engine, task, parameters,
// quantization, library — on a row of five chips under the name. Every one of
// those is read once, by somebody deciding about ONE model; none of them is
// read by sweeping a grid, which is what the face is for. So they moved behind
// a control, and the face kept the three facts a sweep actually asks for: is it
// here, is it loaded, is it arriving (Akshil, 2026-08-24).
//
// **Fixed, never inline.** The panel is `position: fixed` and rendered outside
// the card's flow, so opening it cannot change the card's box — these cards sit
// in a horizontal carousel, and a card that grew on click would shove every
// card to the right of it mid-scroll. That was the explicit ask: "it shouldn't
// change card sizes or layouts, it is a popover".
//
// **One grey for everything in it.** No engine hue, no accent, no dashed
// warning. Those colours are signals, and a signal belongs where a reader can
// see it without asking — on the face, or on the disabled button's own reason.
// This is a fact sheet, and a fact sheet in five colours reads as five kinds of
// urgency.
