// The Local tab: a capability column on the left (`CapabilityNav`) and, on the
// right, everything about whichever one is selected — what this machine HAS,
// what to get next, and a door into a full search of the whole Hub
// (`CapabilityPane` / `HubSearchScreen`), or the one bucket that is not a
// capability at all, the engine files a runner fetched to do its job
// (`EngineFilesPane`).
//
// This is the two-pane port of the page the carousel/table layout used to be.
// The MERGE underneath is unchanged (`aiModelGroups.ts`, D424/D426): one map
// of on-disk truth (`diskCards`) serves both the capability pane's rows and
// the Hub search results, so "you already have this one" has one definition
// per page, and `mergeSections` still decides which rows a capability has and
// in what order. What moved is only the SKIN: a section used to be a
// carousel of `RepoCard`/`RecommendedCard`; it is now `ModelRowModel` rows
// drawn by the shared `ModelRow`, and the Hub search used to replace the
// whole page (`HubResults`) — it now replaces one pane, reached from that
// pane's own "Search Hugging Face for more…" link and left the same way
// (`onBack`), never handing back a different capability than the one it was
// opened from.
//
// **Selecting a capability resets its pane's own transient state** — the
// search screen closes, the (i) drawer closes — the same reset the approved
// mockup's own nav click-handler performs (`st.search = 'closed'; st.info =
// null`), because a capability nobody is looking at should not be quietly
// answering a search or holding a drawer open underneath it.
//
// It still manages the cache too (D250): delete a repo, both ways in named
// only after a confirmation the user reads first (`DeleteDialogs`), the
// dangerous arithmetic (which blobs a revision actually owns) staying on the
// server, where the filesystem is.
//
// THE LISTING IS NOT THIS TAB'S. It arrives as `scan` from the page above
// (lib/useCacheScan.ts), because the walk is shared — see there. What IS this
// tab's is everything below: the curation it joins onto that walk, which
// capability is selected, which row's drawer is open, which delete is
// pending, and what a delete that failed had to say.
