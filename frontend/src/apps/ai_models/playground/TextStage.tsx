// The text stage: one prompt in, one reply out (SPEC AI-1a, reshaped).
//
// This USED to be a chat (ChatStage) — bubbles, history, a bottom-anchored
// composer. The playground unification turned every stage into the same
// API-surface shape: a prompt, a Run, the rendered result of THAT run. A
// developer trying a local model wants exactly what one `fused.ai` call
// returns, and a transcript is state the one-call framing has no place for.
// Because the prompt is now setup rather than transcript, it rides the URL
// (`prompt`) the way the image stage's does — the chat rule ("the URL carries
// the setup, never the transcript") reclassified it.
//
// The stream rides `playgroundClient.streamChat`; a model that is not resident
// answers 409 with the job id of the load this send just started (AI-5), and
// this component owns the dance — watch the job, narrate it, retry ONCE.
//
// A model whose checkpoint has a vision tower (AI-11j: `entry.acceptsImage`,
// grown from an IMAGE_GENERATION-only flag to cover this capability too once
// mlx_text switched to mlx-vlm) can also be handed a picture to ask about,
// on THIS turn only — `mlx_text/worker.py`'s own boundary, which costs this
// stage nothing extra since it already sends `history: []` (a single turn,
// not a chat). Kept deliberately smaller than `ImageStage`'s attachment row:
// no webcam here — a screenshot or a saved photo is the ordinary "what is
// this" ask, and the picker alone covers it without a second capture UI to
// keep in step with the image stage's own.
