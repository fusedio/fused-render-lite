// prompt, Generate — and every parameter behind the Config card, which is
// what replaced the settings rail this stage was first written with.
//
// `ImageStage`'s minimal sibling — no aspect chips, no live preview (this
// build has none), no guidance (H3 is CFG-distilled and takes no such
// parameter). What is genuinely different from an image render: the output
// is a `<video controls>` rather than an `<img>`, `frames` is a fourth
// numeric setting alongside width/height/steps, and a render can run for a
// long time — `onProgress`'s row survives a tab switch (it shows in
// Activity), same as the image stage, and only the WATCH stops on unmount.
// That length is also why this stage keeps the settled caption and the
// gallery strip the image stage dropped: a clip that cost an hour is worth
// naming the seed of, and worth being able to go back to.
