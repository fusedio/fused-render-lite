// The image stage: prompt in, picture out (SPEC AI-9).
//
// Shaped like the text stage (D431): heading, prompt, Generate. Every
// parameter — chips included — lives behind the Config fold.
//
// The controls follow what the image playgrounds converged on (fal, Midjourney
// web, Ideogram, Leonardo): ASPECT RATIO chips, not raw width×height sliders —
// people think in shapes, developer forms think in pixels — with the exact
// size still available under Custom, because the chips are a view over the
// same `w`/`h` URL params, never a new vocabulary. Speed is a chip row too,
// and its numbers come from the CATALOG's per-model hint: FLUX.2 klein is
// step-distilled and was benchmarked at 4 steps (D310) — the generic 28-step
// default turned a ~30-second first image into minutes, which is the
// difference between a playground and a demo that appears broken. A model
// with no CATALOG hint falls back to `FALLBACK_STEPS`, not to the server's
// 28 — see that constant.
//
// A model that can be handed a BASE IMAGE (AI-9f) also gets an attachment row
// at the top of the composer: pick a file, or take one with the webcam. Which
// models those are is the SERVER's answer — `entry.acceptsImage`, computed from
// the resolved engine and the model's own edit variant, the same two gates
// `/api/ai/image` refuses with — never a list of repo ids kept over here. The
// picked bytes land on disk first (`~/ai/inputs`) because the route takes a
// PATH, exactly as the transcribe stage's recording does.
//
// A render is job-shaped — the reply carries the job to watch and the SETTLED
// parameters (width snapped, steps clamped, seed invented). While it denoises
// the worker drops a preview beside the output path and this stage polls it;
// the job survives a tab switch on purpose (it shows in Activity), so only the
// WATCH stops on unmount.
