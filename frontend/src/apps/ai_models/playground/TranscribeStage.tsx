// The transcription stage: record or drop a recording, get the words (AI-10).
//
// The research on record-and-transcribe UX was unambiguous about three things,
// all here: the three states (idle → recording → transcribing) each get their
// own visible treatment; a LIVE LEVEL METER while recording, because the user
// must see "it hears me" before they will talk to it; and words that stream in
// rather than a spinner — the worker appends each segment to a partial JSONL
// beside the output (runners/partial.py) and this stage tails it.
//
// `POST /api/ai/transcribe` takes a PATH — the transcript is a file and the
// run outlives the page on purpose — so both inputs land bytes on disk first
// through `POST /api/fs/upload`, into this stage's own scratch dir under the
// app's cache. A browser file picker has no path to give; the upload is the
// door, not a workaround. Only the WATCH stops on unmount: the run itself is a
// job, visible in Activity.
