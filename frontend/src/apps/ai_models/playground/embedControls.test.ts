// row's own conditions.
//
// **Why source text rather than a render.** What is being pinned is not what
// the controls look like — it is that each one is drawn off the SERVER's own
// flag and off nothing else. `entry.acceptsPaths` is computed from the cached
// checkpoint's `model_type`, and `entry.promptScheme` from the curated scheme
// table; the route refuses the corresponding parameter on exactly the same
// facts. A control drawn off anything a reader could reason about locally — the
// repo id looking like a SigLIP, the capability being embeddings, the model
// being downloaded — is a control whose request comes back 400 for a model
// nobody anticipated. So these tests read the conditions themselves.
//
// The client half is pinned too: `kind` must be OMITTED rather than sent as a
// default when the model has no scheme, since the route 400s it.
