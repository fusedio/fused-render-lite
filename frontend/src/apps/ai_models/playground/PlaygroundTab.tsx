// The Playground tab: pick a local model on the left, use it on the right.
//
// Everything else on /ai-models is ABOUT models — what is on disk, what could
// be, which backend serves it. This tab is the one that answers the first
// question a person has ("what can this thing actually do?") by letting them
// do it: a one-shot prompt for a text model, a prompt-to-picture stage for an
// image model, a record-and-transcribe stage for a speech model. Every stage
// is the same API-surface shape — input, Run, the result of that run — on the
// hero card's centered column. The stage is chosen
// by the selected model's capability, so a capability added server-side gets a
// named placeholder here rather than a blank.
//
// The sidebar is `GET /api/ai/catalog`, verbatim — the same payload every
// page's model picker reads (D323), so a model downloaded from the Local tab's
// Hub search is in the playground with no curation edit. Rows show the curated `nickname`
// (catalog.py) with the full label one hover away.
//
// SELECTING IS NOT LOADING. One model per capability is resident and loading
// evicts (AI-4), so a sidebar where every click moved gigabytes would turn
// browsing into eviction thrash. A click renders the stage and rewrites the
// URL; the weights move when the user acts — Download explicitly, or the first
// generation, which starts the load itself (the chat stage rides AI-5's 409
// dance, image and transcription load inside their own jobs).
//
// The URL carries the setup, never the transcript: `model` plus each stage's
// non-default settings, written with `replaceSearch` because browsing models
// is not history the back button should replay.
