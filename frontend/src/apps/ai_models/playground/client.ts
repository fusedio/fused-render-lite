//
// It exists because the shell cannot ride `runtime.js` — that file is served to
// pages and carries page concerns (params bridge, export rules) the shell must
// not import — and `postJson` cannot stream. So this module holds the three
// things a playground needs that no shell code had: an NDJSON reader over
// `POST /api/ai`, the cold-start dance (a non-resident text model answers 409
// with the job id of the load this call just started — watch it, retry once),
// and the job poll that image and transcription runs are built on.
//
// The wire names are the PAGE's, camelCase (`systemPrompt`, `topP`,
// `maxTokens`) since D633 — the same names `runtime.js` exposes, so nothing
// is its business, not a second contract to copy here.

// SPEC-quiet-notifications.md bug 1/bug 2: `X-Fused-Source` is who RAISED the
// job, deliberately separate from `X-Fused-Page` (never sent by this module
// for image/video — see `startImage`/`startVideo` below). A render's own
// `page` is left to fall back to its output path server-side (`_start_render`'s
// `page or done_page or out_dir`, `fused_render/ai/supervisor.py`) so a click
// still opens the file; sending `X-Fused-Page` here would defeat that by
// making the caller's route win permanently. `source` never inherits that
// fallback (`Job.source`, `fused_render/jobs.py`), so it is the only field a
// presence check can read to suppress a Playground-raised render while the
// Playground itself is still open.
//
// `postJson` (used by `startImage`/`startVideo`/`startTranscribe`/the capture
// starters below) now attaches this automatically (`platform/lib/api.ts`'s
// `ambientSourceHeaders`) — the explicit `{ headers: sourceHeader() }` on
// `startImage`/`startVideo` is redundant with it (same value, and an explicit
// header always wins over the ambient one anyway) but kept for clarity at the
// two call sites the bug report named by hand. `streamChat`/`embedTexts`/
// `embedPaths` below use a raw `fetch` (a streamed response `postJson` cannot
// carry) and so do NOT get the ambient default — this is the one place a
// producer still has to opt in, and it does, via the same shared helper.
