// The embeddings stage: show what "search by meaning" is, in one click.
//
// An embedding model has no output a newcomer can look at — a vector is 768
// floats — so this stage demos the thing vectors are FOR: rank a handful of
// lines against a query by meaning rather than by shared words. The lines come
// prefilled and the query does not — a starter pill fills both and runs, so the
// first ranked list still costs zero typing — and every sample's query
// deliberately shares no word with its best matches: that gap is the whole
// demonstration.
//
// One POST per run (`/api/ai/embed`, SPEC §40): the query and the lines ride
// the same batch, so every score comes from one forward pass. Vectors return
// unit-length (embed_common.unit_normalize, in both workers), so a dot
// product IS the cosine similarity — no other math lives here.
//
// Bars are scaled against the BEST match, never drawn raw: SigLIP
// text-to-text cosines sit around 0.2–0.4, and a 31% bar on the right answer
// reads as broken to the reader this tab exists for. The raw score stays on
// hover. Query and lines are session state, never URL state — they are the
// transcript, and the URL carries only the setup (PlaygroundTab's rule).
//
// **TWO CONTROLS THAT APPEAR PER MODEL, both off the server's own answer**
// (SPEC §40), because the capability serves two shapes of checkpoint and the
// route refuses the wrong parameter for either:
//
// * a query/document toggle, only where `entry.promptScheme` is non-null. A
//   retrieval encoder instructs a question and a passage differently; a dual
//   encoder has no such convention and the route 400s a `kind` sent to one,
//   because a parameter that changed nothing would be worse than one refused.
// * an IMAGES mode, only where `entry.acceptsPaths` is true. That is a vision
//   tower, which a prose encoder does not have.
//
// Both read the server's flags and neither re-derives them, which is the rule
// `imageInput.ts` states for `acceptsImage`: a control drawn off anything else
// is a control whose request comes back 400. `=== true` / `!= null` rather than
// truthiness on a possibly-absent field, for that module's reason too — an older
// server sends neither, and absence has to read as "no control".
