// The composer seed's embeddings branch (SPEC §40).
//
// **Why this is worth a test at all.** The seed is the most authoritative thing
// in a spawned session's context — it is spliced into the prompt at submit time,
// invisible to the user, and read before any code is written. So a seed that
// names a parameter the route REFUSES does not produce a broken build; it
// produces a page written confidently around a call that 400s, and a user who
// blames the model. The two parameters are per-model on this capability, so the
// prose has to be too.
//
// Driven through `buildAppAnnotation`, the exported entry point, rather than the
// private assembler: what is pinned is what a session actually receives.
