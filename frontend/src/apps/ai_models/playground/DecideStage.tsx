// The decisions stage: show what a typed-decision model does, in one click.
//
// Laya (`laya-mlx`) is not a generator. It takes a STATE — a piece of text —
// and typed QUESTIONS, and answers each with a calibrated probability
// distribution: which of these labels (`choice`), how far along this rubric
// (`score`), is this true (`noul`). So the demonstration is not a reply to
// read but a set of bars to compare.
//
// **The questions are the main control, so they live in the main column**,
// not behind the settings cog (owner, 2026-09-22: "bring the main controls
// for a decision model to the front"). A reader meeting this model for the
// first time needs exactly three things in view: the text, what to ask about
// it, and what SHAPE of answer they want — and the answer is drawn right under
// the question that produced it, so asking and reading never split across the
// page. The cog holds only what a novice never touches: the keys the answers
// come back under, and the request JSON a page author would paste.
//
// One POST per run (`/api/ai/decide`): every question rides one request and
// the worker batches them through the encoder, so a run is milliseconds once
// the model is resident. Bars draw the RAW probabilities — they sum to one per
// question, so nothing is rescaled the way the embed stage rescales cosines —
// and the picked label is the one the model would act on. Questions and state
// are session state, never URL state (PlaygroundTab's rule).
