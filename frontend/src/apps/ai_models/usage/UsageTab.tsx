// The Usage tab of /ai-models (SPEC AI-12) — how many tokens `fused.ai` has
// generated in this server process, and when it generated them.
//
// The other three tabs answer questions about models at rest: what is on this
// disk, what could be, which backend would run it. None of them says whether
// anything is actually being GENERATED — so a page stuck in a render loop
// calling `fused.ai.text()` on every tick, or a chat box quietly re-asking the model
// after every keystroke, looked exactly like an idle machine. The graph is what
// makes that visible, and the shape of the bars is the finding: one prompt is a
// spike, a runaway loop is a wall.
//
// Everything here is **this process's own memory** (the server counts into a
// ring, writes nothing to disk, and forgets on restart), which is why the
// footer states when counting began rather than letting a number that resets at
// every app launch pass for a daily total.
//
// The page says INPUT TOKENS and OUTPUT TOKENS, in those words, everywhere —
// tiles, table headers, tier lines, tooltips. They are the names the API's own
// `usage` uses (RH-11) and the names a provider's pricing page uses, and a page
// that called them "read" and "generated" made a reader translate twice: once
// into the wire's vocabulary to check a number, once into a price list's to
// check a cost. Output is the figure the graph draws, because it is the one
// both tiers always report; input is shown where a tier reports it and left as
// "—" where nobody did (SPEC AI-3).
//
// Volume is not the whole question, so three more counters share the tab, each
// answering something the token count alone cannot:
//   * FAILURES, BY KIND — and only by kind. A page whose every call times out
//     has generated zero tokens, indistinguishable from a page nobody opened,
//     so what went wrong is named (`timeout`, `ai_unavailable`, `ai_error`) and
//     the timeline is marked where it happened. There is deliberately NO total
//     "failed" figure in a headline, a tile, or a column: one number over
//     several unrelated conditions is a number a reader cannot act on, and the
//     kinds are the part that sends them somewhere. A model that is merely
//     still loading is not counted at all (AI-12b) — that call started a
//     download and said so.
//   * SPEED (tokens/second, and the seconds behind it). The number anybody
//     choosing between two local models actually wants, and the explanation
//     when a model that landed on the CPU (AI-11b) "feels broken".
//   * TIER. This page's subject is the local half of `fused.ai`, so Claude and
//     local models are counted apart — one merged figure answers neither
//     "what is this laptop doing" nor "what am I sending out".
//
// The one number here that is NOT measured is the ESTIMATED COST, and it is
// labelled that way everywhere it appears. This app knows what a model
// generated; it does not know what anybody is charging for it, so the rate is
// an input box per model rather than a table of prices that would go stale
// silently and be believed anyway. It defaults to $1 per million OUTPUT tokens
// and counts output only — a default nobody's real bill matches exactly, which
// is the point of it being editable and of the word "estimated" beside every
// figure it produces.
