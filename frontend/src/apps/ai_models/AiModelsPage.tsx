// /ai-models — the page chrome, the tab strip, and the dispatch. Nothing else.
//
// Five surfaces share this heading, and only this heading: a playground (pick a
// local model and use it), the Local view (what the Hugging Face cache holds,
// what to download next, a search of the whole Hub, and the deletions that free
// the disk), Benchmark (how fast each of those runs here, on a fixed workload),
// Engines (which backend serves each capability) and Usage (what this process has
// generated). Each owns a directory beside this file; this file owns the frame
// they hang in.
//
// There was a sixth, Discover. The Local tab answers its question now — the
// curated half at D423, the Hub search at D426 — and its directory is gone (see
// routes.ts).
//
// **A tab is a PATH, not a query param** (`/ai-models/local`, routes.ts) — but
// still one mounted component, unkeyed by the nav epoch. The reason is in
// lib/useCacheScan.ts: the cache walk is a filesystem crawl that three of the
// five tabs read, and a remount on every tab click would re-walk every blob in the
// Hugging Face cache. The URL is where the CHOICE lives (so the back button
// undoes it, and so every tab has an address); the mount is where the SHARED
// WORK lives.
//
// Page chrome AND the cards are the cc-* family — cc-mdgrid/cc-mdcard, the same
// card the Claude config panel's MD Files section uses — so the shell's
// non-explorer pages read as one surface rather than each inventing a list.
// Only what those classes have no answer for is local (styles/ai-models.css):
// the size figure, the Explore link, the revision drawer, and the tab strip.
//
// This page's sidebar entry is UNCONDITIONAL (HF-8, D265), so nothing here
// reports the cache's existence to anyone. `data.exists` stays, with the two
// readers it always had: the caption, which only links a cache directory that
// is really there, and the empty state, which says WHICH nothing it found.
