// — a recommendation, or a Hub search result — arriving on disk. Same job row,
// same bytes, same bar — and when they were drawn separately, one of them said
// "Downloaded" while the other was still counting.
//
// The byte counts are the JOB's, never the runtime's. The runtime knows what is
// happening; only the worker doing the fetching knows how far it has got, and it
// reports that to the download manager (SPEC §36) under a deterministic id.

 *
 * It used to be a sibling of the card's Load/Unload button, up in the actions
 * strip, and the report was that it could not be hit: "I don't notice it and I
 * cannot click it because it is fast when I'm trying to load it". Both halves of
 * that are the position, not the button. Up there it appeared and disappeared
 * with the job, which SHIFTED the strip it lives in — so the target moved while
 * being aimed at — and it sat beside a button reading `Unload`, which is a
 * different act on a card that has not finished loading yet.
 *
 * Here it is attached to the thing it stops. This row is only ever drawn while
 * work is in flight, so a control inside it costs no layout when there is none,
 * and its neighbour is the bar rather than an unrelated verb. One shape for both
 * kinds of work: a download and a load now report and cancel identically, which
 * is what the ask asked for ("follow the same UI when loading as well").
