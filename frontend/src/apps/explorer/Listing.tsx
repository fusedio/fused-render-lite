  // **THESE TWO FLAGS ARE NOW THE WHOLE of whether there is a pane** —
  // `pane.on` is exactly `paneEnabled` since D282 deleted the width gate, so
  // "is this a Listing that has a pane" is a question about the SURFACE and
  // never about pixels.
  //
  // There used to be a THIRD flag here, `embedded` — this Listing rendering
  // INSIDE another view's pane rather than as a top-level surface, the no-
  // nesting guard for the preview pane's own `_listing` mode. That mode
  // embedded a real, second `Listing` inside this one's pane so a selected
  // folder could be peeked at without navigating into it — and D460 deleted
  // the entire selection-driven pane that mode belonged to (FS-11): the pane
  // shows the open folder's own companions now, never a selected row's
  // anything, so there is no longer a second `Listing` anywhere for this one
  // to be nested inside. The prop had no caller left once that branch was
  // gone, and is deleted with it rather than kept as a guard against a
  // nesting that can no longer happen.
  //
  // A FROZEN-TREE listing is the first of the two remaining cases: the
  // browsable snapshot (the `browse` framing of the removed timeline mode,
  // PT-14) is a whole shell loaded at `/explorer/embed/<tree>?snapshot=1`, so
  // its Listing is the page's OWN top-level one, inside the framing view's
  // preview column, where it would otherwise grow a preview pane INSIDE a
  // preview pane. `?preview=false` used to stop it and was dropped with the
  // toggle it belonged to, on the reasoning that the width decides — true for
  // a listing that owns its window, false for one handed a column by a
  // framer. *That reasoning is doubly dead now: with the width gate deleted
  // (D282) the framed listing would grow a pane at ANY column width, so this
  // flag is not a refinement of a measurement but the whole answer.*
  //
  // `snapshot=1` and not a second param of its own: the framing flag has
  // exactly one producer, and that producer is a template framing this listing
  // in its own column. A flag that could only ever be written beside another
  // one is the "three places to agree about one bit" the pane's own history
  // (pane.ts) is a warning about.
  //
  // A PANEL PANE is the second, and it is the same shape of blind spot as the
  // snapshot: a pane is a whole shell at `/explorer/embed/<path>`, so its
  // Listing is that frame's own top-level one — `barChrome` true, everything
  // about it says "I own this window". What it does not own is the layout:
  // the user split it, so a split-right of a folder grew two half-width
  // listings each with their own preview. Four columns where the user asked
  // for two — and no width test could ever have objected, because the width
  // was genuinely there. IS_PANEL_PANE is the host-side question a measurement
  // cannot answer (see router.ts, including why `IS_EMBED` — which is also
  // every TAB, where the pane is right and stays — is the wrong flag here).
  //
  // Switching it off HERE is the whole feature: `pane.on` IS this predicate
  // (D282 left nothing else in it), so one flag takes the slot, the divider, the
  // closing chevron on the pane's header, the reopening SideToggleButton in the
  // search row and the two `useDirMode` companion probes with it. Nothing about the
  // ROWS changes: a pane's listing still selects, arrow-keys, and opens on a
  // single click/Enter — opening a file in a pane replaces that pane's
  // document, which is the point.

  // here while it means CLOSED on a file view) are written down in

  //
  // What used to be here was a one-shot effect that walked the settled rows for

  // something in it. It went because the guess is a real action taken on the

  // iframe (and a template's Python) for a file they may never look at, and
  // makes the keyboard's target and every row-scoped action — delete, rename,
  // the pane's expand — point at whatever the sort put first. An empty pane asks

  // carries across the swap (both in useListingSelection: pathFromSelParam and
  // recallSelection), because those are the user's own claims rather than the
  // app's guess. And SEARCH still lands on its top hit, right below — a query is
  // itself a request to look at something, which is exactly what opening a

  //
  // This is the LAST auto-selection in the listing (the folder one is gone,

  // things.
  //
  // WHEN to ask. Not provisional — a scaffold's selection would be torn down

  // that would have followed does not arrive either — so Shift/Mod+click ran
  // this handler and then nothing else, no range was extended, no row toggled,

  //   • `selectstart` on the scroller (registered natively below — React has no
  //     synthetic event for it), which is the browser's own "a selection is
  //     about to begin/extend here" hook and cancels it without touching the

                  seam it collapses toward (SideChrome, where the split is written
                  down), so this button is on screen only while the pane is SHUT.

                  It is not the old pane toggle coming back. That one was an
                  on/off for a bit the layout could answer itself, and it went when
                  the split became a measurement of the container's width — a
                  measurement that is itself gone now (D282): `pane.on` below is
                  just "this Listing has a pane", and this button does not exist
                  where it says no. It is a mode control: it says WHICH of the
                  pane's three would return, wearing that mode's own icon.

                  It also carries more weight than it did. With no width gate, a
                  NARROW window shows the pane like any other, so `_side=off` — and
                  this button back from it — is the only way to give a cramped
                  listing the whole column. That is the trade the flat 30% buys.

                  Here rather than in the crumb bar because over a folder THIS ROW
                  is the bar (it portals into it — search-slot.ts), and this is the

                  folder's own chrome, and the pane's strip is the tab strip
                  alone. A folder that qualifies for no row gets no `⋮` at all

                  would not change either, and the claude template's next boot
