// The chrome a RIGHT-HAND COMPANION COLUMN carries, shared by the two surfaces
// that have one: the file preview's sidebar (PreviewSidebar, over a single file)
// and the folder listing's preview pane (ListingPreviewPane, over a directory).
//
// The two arrived at the same layout from opposite ends and are now one thing
// stated once — a header strip whose left end is the way OUT of the column and
// whose right end is the mode control, over a full-height frame beside a
// draggable seam. Keeping the buttons here rather than one copy each is what
// makes "the folder pane matches the file sidebar" true rather than intended.
//
// ONE AFFORDANCE, TWO PLACES, CHOSEN BY STATE — the rule the listing pane's own
// visibility control already followed (SPEC FS-10):
//
//   CLOSING is a control ON the column — the panel glyph below, first thing in
//   the header, sitting on the seam the column collapses toward and naming the
//   side it is on (platform/ui/PanelIcon).
//   OPENING cannot live there, because a closed column hosts nothing, so that
//   half is the mode-icon button in the host's own bar (the crumb bar for a file,
//   the listing's search row for a folder), rendered ONLY while the column is
//   shut.
//
// Both at once is what the file sidebar's middle version did, and it was the
// wrong answer: the bar's toggle and the column's own close sat a few pixels apart
// across the divider, two buttons for one piece of state, which reads as a
// rendering fault rather than as a choice. Exactly one of them is on screen at
// any moment, and each sits where its own action makes sense.
