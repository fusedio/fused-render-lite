// The file preview's right-hand SIDEBAR: the companion modes (`claude`, `git`
// — lib/mode-visibility's SIDEBAR_MODES) rendered BESIDE the content
// pane instead of in place of it.
//
// Why it exists: those are not other ways of looking at a file, they are things
// you do while looking at it. As ordinary `_mode` entries they were mutually
// exclusive with the view they are about — asking Claude about a .png meant
// giving the .png up — and the chat template answered that by framing its own
// copy of the preview in its own left half, i.e. a second, differently-run
// preview of the same file nested inside the first one's window.
//
// `git` is the one this column does not get from the file: a working tree belongs
// to the FOLDER, so the entry is borrowed from the file's parent directory and
// aimed there (apps/explorer/lib/dir-mode.ts). Nothing in here knows that — the
// entry list and the `src` both arrive as props — but it is why an entry can be
// `pending` for a reason the file's own gate verdicts do not explain.
//
// Owned by TemplatePreview (Preview.tsx): the mode partition, the `_side` URL
// param and the iframe URL shape are all its, so this component is the split's
// right-hand column and the drag that sizes it, and nothing else.
//
// WHERE IT SITS is the layout's whole point. The split is PAGE-LEVEL: the left
// column is the crumb bar AND the content under it, the right column is this, and
// the divider runs the full height of the window between them. So the crumb bar
// ends AT the divider, and this column's header row is the top of the window on
// its side — the two strips reading as one bar split by a seam, exactly as the
// listing and its preview pane do over a folder.
//
// It got there the wrong way first: rendered inside `.preview-body`, i.e. UNDER
// the crumb bar, which then spanned the whole window and left this column's header
// a bar-height below the left column's. Page-level means being a sibling of the
// entire left column, and that column belongs to StatView (shell/App.tsx) — hence
// the portal (preview-side-slot.ts). Rendered as a FRAGMENT of two flex items (the
// divider and the column) into a `display: contents` slot, so both end up direct
// flex children of the split container.
