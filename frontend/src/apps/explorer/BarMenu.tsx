// The two dropdowns the explorer's bars are built from, and the anchoring they
// share.
//
// ModeMenu is the ONE mode control: a bordered trigger showing the active
// mode's icon, the mode's name, and a caret; the dropdown lists every mode
// with radio semantics. It replaces three different surfaces that each said
// "which view is this?" in a different dialect — the topbar's icon strip, the
// preview pane's compact icon strip, and the pane bar's icon-only menu — so
// the same control now appears in all of them, identically.
//
// The icon is drawn in currentColor at the same 16px as every other .bar-ctl
// glyph. An earlier pass put it in a filled accent chip to mark "this is the
// active mode"; on screen that read as a coloured badge shouting for
// attention in a row of quiet chrome. The accent survives where it costs
// nothing — the wash on the dropdown's active row (.bar-menu-item.active).
//
// OverflowMenu is the `···` companion: low-frequency one-shot actions (reveal
// in the file manager, copy path, open in a new tab) that used to be welded
// into the crumb strip as bare glyphs.
//
// Both popups are position:fixed off the trigger's rect rather than absolutely
// positioned: .panel-pane and the tab bar clip their overflow, and a menu that
// works in three of four bars is a menu that will be reported as broken in the
// fourth.
