// The item lists for the explorer's kebab and CRUMB BAR right-click menus, in
// the two states the bar has: over a folder (the listing owns it) and over a
// single file (the preview owns it).
//
// Plain builders taking their actions as callbacks, for the reason every other
// menu in the explorer is built this way (listing/useFileOps, lib/fs-actions'
// buildOpenWithItems): there are no React component tests in this repo, so a
// menu's shape is only checkable when the list is a function of its inputs
// rather than JSX inline in a handler. bar-menus.test.ts is the whole argument.
//
// THE FOLDER MENU IS ONE LIST ON THREE SURFACES — the listing's kebab (`⋮` in
// the search row), a right-click on the listing's empty background, and a
// right-click on the crumb bar over the folder. They used to be three lists:
// the kebab carried the app rows (Share, Open as project, MCP, App Doctor,
// embed) and then the folder ops and the splits; the background right-click
// carried the folder ops alone, in a different order; the bar carried the
// folder ops and the splits. Same folder, three menus that disagreed about
// what you could do to it. `folderMenu` below is the ONE builder: every
// surface hands it the same grouped input and shows the same rows in the same
// order. The rows themselves are not written out here — the folder ops come
// from useFileOps (clipboard, dialogs, refetch it owns), the app rows from
// EntryActionsMenu's hook — so no surface can grow a private copy.
//
// THE FILE MENU IS THE SAME ARRANGEMENT ON TWO SURFACES — the file preview's
// kebab (`⋮` after the mode control) and a right-click on the crumb bar over
// the open file. They used to be two lists: the kebab carried the app rows
// alone, the bar carried Rename, Reveal, the copies and the splits, and nothing
// showed both. `fileMenu` below is the file's ONE builder, the folder menu's
// groups minus `create` (there is nothing to put INTO a file): the app rows
// come from EntryActionsMenu's hook, the file ops from Preview's
// usePreviewFileMenu (its rename dialog, its clipboard, its preview shot).

//         dot, and it is absent on a plain file.
//   file  the file itself: Rename…. Deliberately NOT the preview header's full
//         Finder menu (Preview's buildMenu): no Open With (the mode control is
//         two inches away in the same bar), no Bin/Duplicate/Cut/Copy — a top
