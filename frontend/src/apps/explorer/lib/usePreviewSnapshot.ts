// Preview.tsx's own `_snapshot` resolution, extracted into a small, plain
// hook — mirroring shell/useAppPageSnapshot.ts, which solved the exact same
// problem (code review, round 3, finding 8) for the app page's Overview/
// Files/API tabs: a NON-404 resolve failure used to leave the URL's `sha`
// claimed forever with nothing to show for it and no way stated to the
// caller that this would never resolve on its own (the effect only re-runs
// on `fsPath`/`urlVersion`, neither of which changes just because a fetch
// failed). `error`/`retry` here are that hook's same fix, applied here.
//
// Extracted (not left inline in Preview.tsx, which has no render-test
// precedent anywhere in this codebase — a 2000+ line component with no
// harness) so this resolve/error/retry state machine can be driven through
// the same hook harness (listing/hook-harness.ts — react-test-renderer, no
// DOM) `useSnapshotForFolder.ts`'s own tests already use, rather than only
// through the whole component.
