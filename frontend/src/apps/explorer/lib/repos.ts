// What the Explorer homepage's Repos tab is currently showing, and the copy for
// each state.
//
// This exists as ONE total function over the inputs because deriving the state ad
// hoc did not work. The tab has two independently-updating sources — a
// /api/git-repos response (which can be seconds old) and the live index poll — and
// three rounds of bugs all came from the same shape: reading a boolean from one
// source next to a boolean from the other produces intermediate combinations that
// are not real states. "Still building" forever (no refetch), then the opposite
// flicker ("go rebuild the index" for one frame right after a scan finished), then
// "Still building" forever again for a CANCELLED scan. Each patch created the next
// edge case.
//
// So the states are enumerated instead of derived, the impossible combinations are
// not representable, and the freshness problem is solved where it belongs: the
// caller refetches whenever the index's observable state changes AT ALL (see
// FilesHome), so a scan that completes, is cancelled, fails, or is killed all end
// with a fresh response. That is what lets `liveScanning` simply win here rather
// than being clamped one way — the clamp was the previous fix, and it was a clamp
// precisely because the refetch could not be trusted to happen.
