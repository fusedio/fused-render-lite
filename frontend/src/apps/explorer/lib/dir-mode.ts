// A template mode BORROWED FROM A DIRECTORY by a surface whose subject is not
// that directory.
//
// `git` is what needs it. A working tree belongs to the FOLDER — you stash a
// tree, not a file — so the registry binds `git` to the universal "/" directory
// key alone and its gate refuses anything that is not a directory
// (templates/git/condition.py writes both halves down). A FILE's own
// `stat.templates` therefore never mentions git, and yet "what has changed in
// here" is exactly as useful while reading one file as while browsing its folder.
//
// `mcp` needs it for the same shape of reason and is probed the same way (though
// it opens as a dialog off the bar's kebab now, not as a sidebar entry): the
// `mcp.toml` manifest it curates covers the app FOLDER, so it too is bound to "/"
// alone (templates/mcp/condition.py) and a file's view takes the entry from its
// parent app folder. Nothing here is git-specific — `useDirMode(dir, mode)` takes
// the mode as a parameter, which is why a second folder-bound companion needed a
// new CALLER and not a new module.
// Both companion sidebars borrow it: the file preview's from the file's PARENT
// (apps/explorer/Preview.tsx), the listing pane's from the folder it is BROWSING
// (apps/explorer/Listing.tsx). The listing pane borrows `claude` the same way —
// its chat is the folder view's companion, aimed at whichever row is selected.
//
// Borrowing asks the server the same two questions every other mode surface
// asks, about the directory instead of about the subject:
//
//   GET /api/fs/stat        does this directory offer the mode at all, and which
//                           template folder backs it? (the iframe needs the
//                           path, the switcher needs the icon)
//   GET /api/fs/conditions   does its condition.py gate allow this directory?
//
// NOTHING HERE RELAXES EITHER ANSWER, and that is the point of going through the
// server rather than hard-coding "files in a repo get a git tab". A user registry
// that drops `git` from "/" drops it from these sidebars too, and a gate that
// says false hides it exactly as it would on the folder's own mode menu — the
// verdict policy is lib/mode-visibility's ONE policy, so an entry hides only on
// an EXPLICIT denial and a failed probe cannot silently empty a switcher.
