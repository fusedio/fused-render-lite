// Regression coverage for code review findings 2, 3 and 7 (round 3):
// `clearShellSnapshot` is the ONE place every clear-`_snapshot` path now
// routes through, so this is the one place the sidebar hop
// (`_fusedSnapshotCleared`) needs proving — every caller (Preview.tsx's
// `backToLive` and its resolve-effect's 404 branch, `useSnapshotForFolder`'s
// own `backToLive` and 404 branch) is covered by construction once this
// function itself is right.
//
// `document` is faked per-test (this suite's own throwaway object), not
// added to `platform/lib/testDomShim.ts`'s shared shim: no other suite in
// this process touches `document` at all, so a permanent addition there
// would be a needless shared-state risk for a need exactly one file has —
// the same "per-file throwaway global" precedent
// `useSnapshotForFolder.test.ts` already sets for `location`/`history`.
