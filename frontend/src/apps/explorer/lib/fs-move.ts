// Moving entries into a folder — the ONE implementation of it, shared by every
// gesture that means "put these there".
//
// There are two such gestures now (a drag onto a folder row / the listing
// background, and a drag onto a sidebar bookmark), and they live in different
// component trees, which is exactly why this is a module and not a method on
// the listing's file-ops hook. A second move path would be a second set of
// answers to the questions below — name collisions, entries already in the
// target, a clipboard still pointing at the old location — and the one place
// those are already answered is the cut-and-paste flow, whose rules this
// deliberately mirrors:
//
//   • the DESTINATION NAME keeps the entry's own name when it is free in the
//     target and falls back to the first free "… copy[/ n]" when it is taken
//     (freePastePath) — Finder's keep-both, instead of a bare 409 or an
//     overwrite prompt nobody asked for. This is the "conflict dialog" the
//     explorer has: it resolves the conflict rather than posing it, which is
//     also why a drag needs no confirmation UI of its own;
//   • DESCENDANTS of a dragged folder are dropped from the batch — moving the
//     folder already takes them, and the second call would 404 on a path its
//     own parent just moved (pruneDescendantPaths);
//   • an entry ALREADY IN the target is skipped rather than moved onto itself;
//   • the CLIPBOARD is repointed at the new path, so a pending cut/copy of
//     something that just moved doesn't paste from a dead source.
//
// Sequential, not parallel, for freePastePath's sake: each call resolves a free
// name against a listing, and two in flight would both pick the same one.
