// In-app clipboard for the file explorer's cut/copy (one or more entries, like
// Finder). A cut entry is shown dimmed in the listing until it's pasted.
//
// Deliberately a MODULE-level store, not component state: App keys each
// StatView on `epoch + ":" + fsPath`, so navigating INTO a folder remounts
// Listing — a useState clipboard would be wiped on the way, killing the whole
// copy-here / paste-there gesture. Lifting it out of the remount boundary
// keeps a cut/copy alive across navigation (and cut-dimming reappears when you
// browse back to the source dir). One clipboard for the whole app, like the OS.
//
// PERSISTED IN sessionStorage, not localStorage: localStorage would share one
// clipboard across every window the browser has open, including ones from a
// session long over. sessionStorage is scoped per tab, with one documented
// exception: Chrome and Firefox CLONE it into a tab opened FROM the current
// one (`target=_blank`, middle-click, Cmd-click on a link) — exactly the
// affordance every folder link in this app offers (router.ts's spaLinkProps).
// A cut three files, middle-click a folder card, and the new tab starts with
// the same pending cut and the same cut-dimming; paste it there and the files
// move, while the original tab still shows a cut whose sources are gone (its
// own paste then fails or no-ops). The two tabs' clipboards are independent
// from that point on — nothing here coordinates them — so this divergence is
// a known, accepted gap rather than a bug to chase. A reload of THIS document
// (a hard nav the user didn't intend, or a dev refresh) must not silently
// drop the clipboard either, which sessionStorage also gives for free.
// `clipboard` and `lastSeenOsToken` are written and
// restored TOGETHER as one JSON blob under one key, never as two separate
// entries, because they are one fact: the pair says both "what the user is
// holding" and "what we've already reconciled against the OS clipboard for
// it". Restoring `clipboard` alone would leave a fresh document's
// `lastSeenOsToken` at `""`, and the mount-time reconcile (os-clipboard.ts)
// would then read any non-empty OS clipboard as unseen and adopt it straight
// over the cut this module just restored.
