// The file preview's `_side` split, as decisions rather than as JSX — the file
// half of what pane-side.ts is for the folder listing's pane, and DOM-free for
// the same reason: the rules below are all about a list that is ASSEMBLED from
// two sources with different timings, which is exactly the thing a test should
// pin and a React component should not be the only statement of.
//
// **AN ABSENT `_side` MEANS OPEN, AT THIS FILE'S DEFAULT COMPANION** (D326), and
// shut is the word `off` — the same reading the folder pane has always had, and
// the reversal of the asymmetry both modules used to state at length ("file:
// absent = CLOSED; folder: absent = OPEN"). The old rule was defensible on its
// own terms — a sidebar is an extra beside a content view that is complete
// without it, so nothing meant nothing — but it made the sidebar's presence a
// PREFERENCE, and a preference has to be stored somewhere. It was, twice over:
// in the URL, and from there into the file's session sidecar (lib/session), which
// replayed it on every later bare open. So one file remembered a sidebar for
// months while its neighbour never had one, and the app had no way back to a
// uniform starting state. The owner's words were "we don't want any persisted
// preference. similar to folder sidebars, they should always open at a fixed 30%
// size on page refresh. any other changes being made (open/width) must be
// persisted only for the session."
//
// So the whole of `_side` on a file is now a REQUEST FOR THIS DOCUMENT: read off
// the URL at mount (`parseSide`), resolved against what the file offers on every
// render (`resolveSide`), carried across the shell's pushState navigation because
// the URL carries it, and gone on a refresh because a bare URL opens at the
// default again. The width follows the same policy in `lib/side-store.ts`, and
// `_side` is stripped out of anything that persists a url (lib/session-params,
// whose only consumer is now the recents store) so nothing can put the old
// behaviour back. *The session sidecar that used to be the other consumer — and
// the reason that strip exists at all — is gone with the per-file session restore
// (D329), server-side `_strip_side` included.*
//
// THE TWO SOURCES, and the whole reason this module exists:
//
//   OWN         the companions in the file's own stat.templates — `claude`, and
//               a `git` only if a user registry bound one to the
//               extension. These EXIST as of the stat; a conditional one's GATE
//               may still be in flight (CT-12), but the entry is real.
//   BORROWED    `git`, from the file's PARENT FOLDER (lib/dir-mode). Until that
//               probe answers there is only a PLACEHOLDER — an entry whose path
//               and icon are null and which may turn out not to exist at all,
//               because the parent may be outside a repository.
//
// A placeholder is listed anyway, because `_side` is read from the URL at MOUNT:
// resolve `?_side=git` against a list that does not mention git yet and the
// reconcile below rewrites the param away before the answer lands. But listing it
// is ALL it may do. A pending placeholder must not decide anything the user can
// see, and that is the difference between `offered` and `on` below:
//
//   offered   there is SOMETHING that may end up in the sidebar, so a `_side`
//             naming it is honoured instead of stripped. Pending included.
//   on        the split is really on: a companion is KNOWN to exist, so the
//             sidebar column and its toggle may render and the content pane's
//             mode list drops the companions.
//
// Conflating the two is what made a companion-less file (a .pdf, a video) open
// with a Git toggle in its bar for as long as the probe took and then lose it
// again — a control flashing in and out on every open, for a folder that has no
// working tree at all.
//
// Note the asymmetry with an OWN conditional companion, which DOES count as
// settled while its gate resolves. Its entry is in this file's template list
// either way, so the only question open is whether it is allowed; treating it as
// unsettled would move it between the content menu and the sidebar as the verdict
// landed, which is a worse flash than the one this module removes.
//
// **THAT ASYMMETRY DOES NOT REACH `defaultSide`** — the one thing an absent `_side`
// consults (D326). "Settled enough to be listed and toggled to" is not "settled
// enough to OPEN BY ITSELF": `claude` ships a condition.py, so on every file it is
// pending for as long as /api/fs/conditions takes, and auto-opening it would put an
// empty column on screen that vanishes when a mount-backed file's verdict comes
// back false. Both kinds of pending are excluded there and only there; see the
// field.
//
// THE THIRD LIST, `menu`, and why it is not either of the two above: what the
// SWITCHER shows is now EVERY COMPANION, ALWAYS — the ones this file has not
// got listed as disabled rows carrying the reason why (mode-visibility's
// `unavailableReason`, where the argument for saying it out loud is written down).
// So the sidebar's header reads the same over every file, and a file outside a
// repository gets a Git row that explains itself instead of a switcher that
// quietly shrank — or, at one entry, disappeared.
//
// A disabled row is a LABEL, not a mode, and none of the rules above may see it:
// it does not turn the split `on`, it is not `settled`, it never becomes the
// toggle's target, and `initialSide`/`reconcileSideSearch` resolve a `?_side`
// naming it exactly as they resolve one naming a mode nobody has ever heard of —
// away. Hence three lists rather than a flag on one: `menu` is for drawing,
// `all` is what a `_side` may name, `settled` is what actually exists. Feeding
// the drawing list to any of the decisions would put a file back on a Git view
// its folder cannot produce, which is the failure `on` vs `offered` exists to
// prevent, arrived at from the other direction.

  //                                  Auto-opening it puts an empty column on screen
  //                                  (`src` null) which then VANISHES on a
  //                                  mount-backed file, where the verdict is no —

  //                                  default is also what the content pane does
  //                                  (`defaultMode`, CT-12, and the server's own

  //                                  `claude` gate is freshly in flight. Taking "the
  //                                  best resolved companion" opened the column on
  //                                  Git and then SWAPPED it to Claude when the gate

  //                                  whoever was already reading it, on the common
  //                                  path rather than in a corner.

  // **WHY LIVE RECOMPUTATION IS SAFE ONCE THE RULE IS THIS**, rather than needing to

  // `resolveSide` resolves a NAMED mode against `all`, so it neither waits for the
  // leader nor follows it.
  //
  // Note this is deliberately NOT `defaultSidebarMode` over some filtered list. That
  // function answers "the best of these", which is the question that produced the
  // swap; the question here is "what will still be true in a moment".
  //
  // It is also the value that decides the URL's SPELLING (`sideParam`): the

// Keeping the URL honest about what is actually open, for the cases the user's
// own clicks don't cover. Returns the query string to REPLACE the current one
// with (no leading "?"), or null when it already agrees and must be left alone.
//
// Three jobs:
//
//   1. the legacy `?_mode=claude` migration above — drop the param the split
//      re-homed, once. Only where the split is on offer, since everywhere else
//      `_mode=claude` still names a real content mode. Note that the migration is
//      now usually a pure DELETION: the sidebar opens at the chat from a bare URL
//      anyway, so there is nothing to write in `_mode`'s place unless the chat is
//      not what this file would open by itself.
//   2. a `_side` this file cannot honour: a param carried in from another view
//      (the folder pane writes `_side` too), or one whose gate has just DENIED
//      the mode. It goes — but "goes" now means "back to absence, which means the
//      default", not "the sidebar closes". The denied mode is still LISTED, as the
//      disabled row that says why (see the header), and that changes nothing here:
//      a row the user cannot select is not a state the URL is allowed to hold.
//   3. write `_side` when state moved without the user's click, and equally DROP
//      one that says no more than absence already says (`_side=claude` where
//      claude is the default) — the normalisation `sideParam` states.
//
// **A STILL-PENDING BORROWED ENTRY SUSPENDS ALL OF IT**, and there are two shapes
// of that now. The old one: `activeSide` is the pending mode, `_side` already says
// so, nothing to do. The new one: the request is OPEN, nothing is settled, so
// there is no default to open at and `activeSide` is null — and `off` must NOT be
// written there, because that would shut the sidebar for good on a file whose only
// companion is about to prove it exists. Both leave `_side` exactly as it is; the
// verdict is what settles it, and a denial that empties the list brings us back to
// job 2 through `offered`.
//
// Only ever on a splitting surface: a panel pane renders `claude` as its content
// mode and a folder's `_side` is the listing pane's (listing/pane-side.ts), so
// nothing here may touch either.
