// resolved-snapshot singleton (platform/lib/snapshot-param.ts), writes the
// URL, and tells the git sidebar so its own "previewing" banner and
// Checkout/Revert controls do not outlive the pane they describe.
//
// Extracted because THREE call sites used to each hand-roll this clear, and
// only ONE of them (Preview.tsx's own `backToLive`) remembered the sidebar
// hop (code review, round 3, findings 2 and 3):
//
//   * Preview.tsx's `backToLive` — the sidebar's own "back to live" click,
//     routed here via `window._fusedSnapshotSelected`, and the content
//     pane's own banner button. Had the hop.
//   * Preview.tsx's resolve effect, on a confirmed 404 for THIS pane whose
//     sha no other pane holds — cleared the singleton/URL by hand, with no
//     hop. That is the bug findings 2 was filed against: the pane silently
//     drops to live while the sidebar still shows an ARMED, DESTRUCTIVE
//     Checkout for a version nothing on screen shows any more.
//   * Listing.tsx's own "back to live", which goes through
//     `useSnapshotForFolder.ts`'s OWN `backToLive` — a second, independent
//     hand-rolled copy, also with no hop, despite Preview.tsx's own comment
//     CLAIMING this case was covered (finding 3).
//
// One function, every clear path calls it, is what makes a FOURTH clear path
// (a future one) hard to get wrong the same way again — there is nothing
// left to duplicate.

//   * no sidebar mounted at all (`document.querySelector` finds nothing);
//   * a sidebar mounted but showing something other than `git`
//     (`_fusedSnapshotCleared` absent on that template);
//   * an older build of the git template with no such export.
//   * (finding 7) a side frame that is ever cross-origin or sandboxed —
//     `.contentWindow` on such a frame is still truthy, but reading a
//     property off it throws `SecurityError` rather than returning
//     `undefined`. Latent today (every side frame this shell ever mounts is
//     same-origin) but the comment this replaces asserted "both ends fail
//     safe" without actually guarding against it, so a future cross-origin
//     frame would have thrown, uncaught, from inside a caller that had
//     already written the URL — aborting the rest of that caller's own
//     cleanup. Guarded here, once, rather than at every call site.

/** Clear `_snapshot` for the whole shell: the singleton, the URL, and the
 *  git sidebar's own idea of what is previewed. Callers still own their OWN
 *  local mirror of the singleton (Preview.tsx's `resolvedSnapshotState`,
 *  `useSnapshotForFolder`'s local state) — this does not know about those,
 *  the same reason `setResolvedSnapshot` alone never re-renders anything
 *  (see snapshot-param.ts's own comment). Call this, then clear the local
 *  mirror the same way every existing caller already does.
 *
 *  ROUND 5, ITEM A: the URL write (`replaceSearch`) only happens when it
 *  would actually CHANGE the URL. Both `usePreviewSnapshot` and
 *  `useSnapshotForFolder` call this unconditionally from their effect's
 *  `!isSha(raw)` early-return branch — the branch that runs on EVERY
 *  ordinary render with no `_snapshot` param at all, not only the ones
 *  genuinely clearing a previous one. `replaceSearch` routes through
 *  `history.replaceState`, which main.tsx wraps to dispatch
 *  `fused:urlchange` UNCONDITIONALLY (it does not compare old/new url) —
 *  and `urlVersion` (bumped by that event, `platform/lib/hooks.ts`'s
 *  `useUrlVersion`) is in the dep array of both of those very effects. An
 *  unconditional write here is therefore a same-tick infinite loop on every
 *  page with no `_snapshot`: effect -> write -> event -> urlVersion bump ->
 *  effect -> write -> ... — observed for real as a
 *  "history.replaceState() more than 100 times per 10 seconds"
 *  SecurityError and a totally blank explorer. Comparing the COMPUTED
 *  search string against the current one (rather than just checking
 *  whether `_snapshot` is present) is the robust guard: it also covers a
 *  caller some day asking this to drop a DIFFERENT already-absent param, or
 *  `_snapshot` being present but already stripped by an intervening write.
 *  The singleton clear and the sidebar hop are cheap and side-effect-free
 *  the second time, so they still run unconditionally — only the write
 *  that can trigger the loop is guarded. */

 *
 *  Calls `clearShellSnapshot` — the same hop every other "nothing is

 *  already-confirmed snapshot (this pane, or a companion one) survives a
 *  failed attempt to preview some OTHER commit rather than being clobbered
 *  by it. That one case (already confirmed A, a click at B fails) is left
 *  exactly as swallowing it always was — the sidebar may still show B as
 *  "previewing" until another click corrects it — because correcting it
