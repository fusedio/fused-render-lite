// FilesSearch, DRIVEN: a query is typed, a rank/stat reply lands, the clock
// moves past the debounce. Everything here is a SEQUENCE, which a plain
// function test over `home-search.ts` cannot exercise — the component wires
// the pure helpers there to real state and real timers, and that wiring is
// exactly what sections 2 and 7 of the overhaul touch.
//
// react-test-renderer, the same tool hook-harness.ts uses: no DOM, real React,
// real effects. The Clock/flush pair is reused from there rather than
// re-invented — the same virtual-timer shape a per-query round trip needs.
//
// Deliberately NOT `mock.module("@platform/lib/api", ...)`. That looks like
// the obvious way to control indexRank/statPath, and it is exactly what broke
// CI: `mock.module` replaces the module for the WHOLE bun process — every
// FILE, not just this one — and a real ES module namespace export is frozen
// (confirmed directly: assigning to one throws "Attempted to assign to
// readonly property"), so there is no way to patch just the two functions
// this file needs and leave the rest of the module alone. Registering the
// mock AGAIN with the real module as the factory does not reliably undo it
// either — a module that already imported the mocked version (fs-actions.ts,
// loaded fresh by fs-actions.test.ts AFTER this file's restore had already
// run) still came back with a stale/broken binding, which is what turned
// into a passing-locally, hanging-in-CI 5s timeout in a file this diff never
// touches. The REAL functions here are both thin `getJson`/fetch wrappers, so
// this stubs `globalThis.fetch` instead — a plain, unfrozen global — exactly
// the technique fs-actions.test.ts/fs-clipboard.test.ts already use for the
// same reason.
