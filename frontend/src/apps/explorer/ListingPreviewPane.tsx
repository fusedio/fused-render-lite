// Right-hand preview pane for the directory listing (views/Listing.tsx): the
// OPEN FOLDER's companions — `claude` (chat about the folder) and `git` (its
// working tree) — never the selection. (`mcp`, its MCP tools, is a dialog off the
// search row's kebab rather than a pane mode.)
// listing/pane-side.ts owns the list and the `_side` param that records which.
//
// **THE PANE NO LONGER FOLLOWS THE SELECTION AT ALL** (D460, superseding
// D280/D281/D284's whole arc). It used to be selection-driven: a selected row's
// own template (`Preview`), Claude's target following whichever row was
// selected, a selected folder previewed as an embedded listing. All of that
// read the listing's selection, and every one of the bugs those four decisions
// fixed one at a time (a folder's app running merely because it was
// highlighted, a stale companion following a row across a rename, a "Select a
// file to preview." hint under a pill reading something else) was some shape
// of "the pane's content changed for a reason the user did not click" — which
// a pane that shows the OPEN FOLDER's own companions cannot do at all, because
// there is nothing left for it to read off the selection. `folder` is the
// pane's only subject now, on every mode, always.
//
// The fallback (`side === "preview"`, `PANE_SIDE_FALLBACK`) is what the pane
// shows when NEITHER companion is offered (a mount-backed folder, where both
// gates refuse) — a plain folder-scoped hint, never a row's template: there is
// no row to resolve one for any more.
//
// The header is the file sidebar's header, to the button: the way out of the
// column at its left end, the mode pill at its right (SideChrome). Wire-up
// state — whether there is a pane at all, its width, the divider drag, and
// `_side` itself — stays in Listing; this component owns only what the pane
// shows.
