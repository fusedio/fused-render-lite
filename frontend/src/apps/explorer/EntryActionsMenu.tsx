// THE APP-LEVEL ROWS — every app-level action that used to stand in the crumb
// bar as its own bordered button — App Doctor, Export App, Open in project —
// plus the fullscreen glyph and the MCP companion. Four labelled buttons and
// two glyphs in a 28px strip was a toolbar competing with the mode control for
// the bar; the mode control is what the bar is FOR, and these are things you
// do to the app once in a while.
//
// One export that matters: `useAppActionRows`, the hook. It owns the entry
// probe, the App Doctor's checks and modal, the Share sheet's version logic,
// and returns the rows as ContextMenu MenuEntry[] in two groups (`app`,
// `embed`) plus the trigger badge and the modal node. It renders no menu of its
// own: the FOLDER LISTING composes the groups with its folder ops into the one
// folder menu (bar-menus' folderMenu) that its kebab, its background
// right-click and the crumb bar all show, and the FILE PREVIEW composes them
// with its file ops into the one file menu (bar-menus' fileMenu) that its kebab
// and the crumb bar's right-click both show — so the same row is never spelled
// twice. (A thin `EntryActionsMenu` component wrapped the hook for the file
// kebab until that kebab and the bar's right-click were merged; the file is
// named after it still, since every comment in the tree points here by name.)
//
// ONE ENTRY PROBE. The three buttons each asked /api/apps/entry whether the
// previewed page is its folder's app entry (the server's own entry rule, never
// the filename) and each hid itself when it was not. That is one question asked
// three times per file; it is asked once here, and the answer gates the three
// entry-only rows together. The two rows that are not about "the app" — Open in
// embed, MCP config — are gated on their own facts (always, and whether the parent
// folder offers an MCP companion), so a plain html file still gets a kebab.
//
// The App Doctor's STATUS DOT rides the kebab trigger's corner while the menu is
// shut (OverflowMenu's `badge`): its whole job is to be seen without a click, and a
// dot on a row inside a closed menu is a dot nobody sees. It repeats on the row
// so the two agree.
//
// The bodies are the deleted buttons' bodies, verbatim where it matters:
//   * Share (which absorbed the Download row — the sheet behind it holds both
//     the public link and the .fused file) keeps Export's
//     `snapshotPending || snapshotError` guard and its `.preview-frame.is-shown`
//     capture source (see `doShare`);
//   * Open as project puts the folder on the sidebar's desk first, then
//     navigates in THIS tab, spelled by hand since an app may not import
//     shell/current-apps-lib;
//   * Open in embed is a NEW TAB now (`window.open`) — the old fullscreen button
//     replaced this document (`location.assign`), and a way out only through
//     EmbedStrip's "Open in explorer" is a poor trade for a menu row that says
//     "open"; the explorer stays where it was. Its URL is still the caller's
//     (Preview.tsx owns the `_mode` stamp rule).
//   * MCP config opens the parent folder's `mcp` template in a dialog
//     (McpDialog) rather than in the sidebar, whose two remaining companions are
//     tabs now (SideChrome's SideTabs). The dialog's open state lives in
//     Preview.tsx because Open With → MCP has to reach it too.
