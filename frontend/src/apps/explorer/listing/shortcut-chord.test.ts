// The listing's chord table: which key events it claims, and — the part that
// cost a real bug — which ones it must leave alone.
//
// Dispatch is testable because the decision is pure (listing/shortcut-chord.ts);
// the hook around it needs a DOM and a React renderer, and the frontend test
// setup has neither (see the DOM-free stubs in platform/lib/*.test.ts). One
// source guard survives from when this file could only read text, for the
// reload chord — see its own test.
//
// PLATFORM: `isMac` is detected once at import (lib/platform) and is NOT a
// parameter of the matcher — see the note above matchChord for why re-deriving
// it from an argument would be a second copy of the app's one platform rule. So
// these tests read the SAME detection the matcher does and drive the table it
// actually built:
//
//   • the primary modifier is spelled `mod(...)`, which is Meta on a Mac and
//     Ctrl elsewhere, and `wrongMod(...)` is the other one (never the primary,
//     on either platform — that exclusivity is a rule under test);
//   • the two platform-SPLIT branches (Delete, Backspace) assert both sides,
//     picked by the same isMac.
//
// It used to hard-code Ctrl and assert "isMac is false in this process, which
// reports no navigator". That stopped being true — bun ≥1.3 exposes a
// `navigator` with a real `platform` — and the whole file went red on macOS
// while testing nothing new.
//
// TWO LIMITS OF READING THE DETECTION, both of them real and neither of them
// fixed by this file. Say them out loud so nobody reads more assurance into a
// green run than is there:
//
//   1. NOTHING HERE ASSERTS THAT THE DETECTION IS RIGHT. `isMac` is the same
//      value the matcher used, so if detectMac() regressed to always-false the
//      matcher and these tests would drift together and stay green while every
//      Mac user's ⌘ chords quietly stopped working. What is tested is that the
//      table is CONSISTENT with the detected platform, not that the platform was
//      detected correctly.
//   2. EACH SPLIT IS ONLY HALF-COVERED ON ANY ONE MACHINE. A run on macOS
//      exercises the mac side of `isMac ? … : …` and reduces the other side to
//      "matchChord returned null" — which is also its answer for a chord it has
//      never heard of, so the non-mac assertion can pass with the branch
//      deleted. shortcut-chord-nonmac.test.ts closes that by running the matcher
//      in a child process with a Linux `navigator`; between the two files both
//      halves are exercised whichever machine runs them.
