//
// Code review finding (Cursor Bugbot, 2026-09-10): `mode`, `reason` and
// `displayHits` are all read off the same `answer` object, and that object
// only changes when a new one lands — so they move in lockstep with EACH
// OTHER. They do NOT move in lockstep with `q`: `q` (`useDeferredValue`)
// catches up to a keystroke well before the fetch effect's own trailing
// debounce fires the request that would produce a new `answer` for it. In
// that window — box already showing the next query's text, but no request
// for it even out yet — `scanPending` (`pending || polling`) is still
// false, because `pending` is not set until the debounce elapses and `run()`
// actually issues the call. A "settled" check built from
// `!scanPending && searchState.status !== "pending"` alone reads that window
// as settled, and licenses a broaden offer for a query that was never
// checked for zero hits at all.
//
// `rowsAnswerQuery` (useListingSearch.ts) already exists to answer exactly
// this: it compares the answer actually on screen against `q` directly
// (`staleRows`), so it goes false the instant `q` moves past what `answer`
// is for — no request needs to have gone out yet. Requiring it here is the
// fix: one flag that says which query the rows/mode/reason on screen answer,
// instead of trusting `scanPending` and `searchState` to have already caught
// up.
