// The MOVE-DRAG, driven by pointer events: one module-level gesture, started by
// the listing's press arbiter (useMarquee) and run to completion from here.
//
// WHY THIS IS NOT HTML5 DRAG-AND-DROP ANY MORE. `draggable` is a flag the
// browser reads when the movement BEGINS, not when the button goes down — and a
// press on an unselected row selects it on pointerdown, so the row was always
// selected (and so always `draggable`) by the time the browser looked. Every
// press on an unselected row therefore armed a move-drag before the sweep could
// claim the gesture, which is the bug the user reported as "dragging a row from
// the size/modified column still tries to move it". No rule stated in
// drag-drop.ts can fix that, because the native API does not consult it at the
// moment that matters. Owning the pointer is the fix: the gesture is decided
// ONCE, at pointerdown, from a snapshot of the selection taken before the press
// could change it (drag-drop's pressStartsDrag).
//
// WHAT THE NATIVE API WAS GIVING US, and where each piece went:
//
//   dragover/dragenter/drop targeting   → hit-testing on pointermove with
//                                         document.elementFromPoint, against
//                                         the SAME dropIsValid verdict.
//   the move / no-drop cursor           → body classes (explorer.css), since
//                                         `dropEffect` no longer paints them.
//   setDragImage                        → the .fs-drag-image element, moved by
//                                         this module on every pointermove.
//   surviving a remount mid-drag        → module-level state (this file) and the
//                                         module-level in-flight store, plus a
//                                         DOM protocol (data-fs-drop-*) rather
//                                         than React handlers, so a target the
//                                         spring-load has just re-rendered is
//                                         still a target.
//   Escape / an ended drag              → an Escape key listener and
//                                         pointercancel, wired here.
//
// THE DOM PROTOCOL. A drop target declares itself with attributes, not with
// handlers, and this module never holds a reference to one:
//
//   data-fs-drop-path      the folder entries would move INTO
//   data-fs-drop-dir       "1" | "0" — is that path a directory? Absent means
//                          NOT KNOWN YET (a sidebar bookmark, which only the
//                          server can answer for): treated optimistically as a
//                          folder and probed, exactly as the sidebar's own
//                          handler used to.
//   data-fs-drop-announce  the target is OFF SCREEN, so the move has to say so
//                          (a toast) — a sidebar bookmark, and a crumb.
//   data-spring-target     a breadcrumb crumb: hovering it navigates there with
//                          the drag still held. An ANCESTOR crumb carries the drop
//                          attributes above as WELL as this one — it is a real
//                          target (hold to open, release to move into) and
//                          declares itself a directory without a probe. The
//                          current-folder crumb carries only the drop attributes,
//                          since springing to where you already are is a no-op —
//                          and it is the crumb under the pointer once a
//                          spring-load has fired (see refreshDropTarget).
//
// EVERY DECISION belongs to drag-drop.ts (pure, tested) and marquee.ts's slop /
// auto-scroll arithmetic (likewise). What is here is wiring, kept thin on
// purpose: a headless test cannot see a drag, so nothing it cannot see is
// allowed to decide anything.

// the target is resolved in onPointerMove and in the auto-scroll loop, and
// neither runs while the user holds still. That was safe as long as the DOM
// under the pointer held still too — and spring-loading a breadcrumb breaks
// exactly that, from three directions at once:
//
//   • the crumb the pointer is on is REPLACED. Navigating to it makes it the
//     current-folder crumb, a different element (and, until this change, one
//     with no drop attributes at all, so the hit test found nothing, the body
//     wore the no-drop cursor over the very crumb being aimed at, and the
//     release returned early and moved nothing);
//   • the strip RE-LAYS-OUT under a stationary pointer — fewer segments, and the
//     tail re-pinned into view — so a different crumb can slide under the
//     cursor. The release hit-tests fresh, so without a repaint here the painted
//     target and the dropped-into folder could disagree, which is a silent wrong
//     destination;
//   • the armed highlight is React state, and the re-render it causes writes
//     `className` from scratch, WIPING the drop ring this module painted
//     imperatively. Nothing would repaint it until the next pointermove, so the
//     per-crumb "which ancestor gets this" signal vanished for the rest of the
//     dwell.
//
// So the strip calls this whenever it changes — from its own render, and from a
// ResizeObserver and scroll listener, because chrome portalling into the crumb bar
// after a navigation re-lays it out asynchronously, long after any render this
// module could be told about. The three holes then close together: the spot is
// rebuilt against the live DOM, the highlight is re-applied, and what is painted
// is what a release would use, because both come from this one hit test.
