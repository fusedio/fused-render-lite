// Who owns the explorer's CRUMB BAR right now — the shell, or whichever view
// underneath it has the merged field (a folder's Listing, or a plain file's
// FileSearchField).
//
// Over a FOLDER the bar is wrong in two different ways. Its layout zone offers
// to tear the window in half at the moment the view is already a split (list +
// preview pane), which is the one place a second one buys nothing; and the
// `···` sits at the far end of a bar whose other end is the path, three
// hundred pixels from the search box that is the folder's actual control. So a
// folder view CLAIMS the bar: the splits go away and the `···` re-renders
// inside the listing's search row, next to the thing it acts on (Listing.tsx).
// A plain FILE claims the bar too (FileSearchField.tsx), for the same reason
// the star and the click-to-edit path give way to the field's own copies —
// but claims no slot: a file has no split column for the bar to move into, so
// it stays exactly where it always rendered, spanning the shell's full width.
//
// The claim can also carry a SLOT — a node inside the listing's left column
// that the whole bar portals into (Breadcrumb.tsx `BreadcrumbBar`). That is
// what makes the preview pane full height: with the bar confined to the left
// column, the pane's own header is the topmost thing on the right and the pane
// runs from the top of the window to the bottom. Only a folder's own claim
// carries one; a file's claim (and a folder rendered inside a panel pane,
// which never claims at all) leaves it null.
//
// A module store rather than a prop because the two components are SIBLINGS —
// App renders <Breadcrumb> above <Listing>/<Preview>, and which of those the
// content resolves to is decided several levels down (a directory's `_mode`
// can leave the listing for `git` without remounting the bar). The
// same shape as lib/ui-overlay and fs-clipboard: state that lives just outside
// a remount boundary, with a subscribe/snapshot pair for useSyncExternalStore.
//
// A STACK, not a boolean: a claim is released on unmount, and a swap can hold
// two folder views at once (folder→folder hop, scaffold→resolved), so a
// straight `false` on release would leave the bar hidden or doubly rendered
// depending on which side of the swap ran last. The newest claim wins — during
// a swap that is the incoming view, whichever order the commit runs in. Claims
// are idempotent per caller (each returns its own release, called at most once
// by the effect that made it).
