// nothing typed. Same segments as Breadcrumb.tsx's own path strip, built the
// same way, but click-to-navigate only: no spring-loaded drag targets, no
// GNOME-style shrink-on-overflow. Those stay with the plain-file bar
// (deferred, see DECISIONS-one-field-search.md) — decision 1 is the merge
// itself, not carrying every crumb-strip behavior into the new home.
