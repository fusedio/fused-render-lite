// A callback ref, not an object ref plus a mount-only effect — because the
// element it watches does not stay put. The search box this ref attaches to
// (Listing.tsx's `searchBoxRef`) gets portaled into the crumb bar once a
// folder claims it (search-slot.ts), and a portal swap REBUILDS the subtree:
// the inline node is torn down and a new one is created inside the portal
// target (see node-slot.ts's own comment on exactly this failure mode — "a
// reference captured at mount would then point at a detached div"). An
// object ref read once inside a `useLayoutEffect(..., [])` measures whichever
// node existed at that first commit and never looks again: if the swap
// happens moments later, the observer stays attached to a node that has
// already left the document, and the width it reports freezes forever.
//
// A callback ref has no such blind spot — React calls it with `null` on
// every unmount and with the fresh node on every mount, portal swaps
// included, so re-attaching here on each call keeps the measurement current
// no matter how many times the underlying node is rebuilt.

// THE OMNIBOX-OVERLAP-DEFECT FOLLOW-UP (running-screen review, 2026-09-13):
// the trailing "Search ⌘L" button's reservation against the crumbs strip
// used to be a hand-estimated pixel count in explorer.css, sized generously
// for the widest label form ("Ctrl L") so it would never be too tight. That
// generosity is exactly the new defect — a Mac user's shorter "⌘L" label (or
// the collapsed glyph) leaves the estimate reserving far more than the
// button actually occupies, and the crumbs give up that dead space for
// nothing, truncating a long path to a leading ellipsis with visible air
// between its tail and the button. An estimate cannot be right on both
// platforms, both label forms, and every font/zoom setting at once — only
// measuring the button's OWN rendered position can be.
//
// `useControlReservationRef` measures the gap a "control" element (here, the
// shortcut button) actually occupies against a "box" element's right edge —
// `box.right - control.left`, i.e. exactly the CSS `right` value the button
// is already positioned with (8px unscoped, 38px past the star in the
// crumb-slot host) PLUS the button's own current rendered width. Reading it
// out of the DOM this way, rather than duplicating those 8px/38px insets
// here, means a future change to either host's inset needs no matching edit
// in this file: the geometry is the single source of truth, this hook only
// reports it.
//
// Two elements, not one ResizeObserver on the control alone: the control's
// `right: Npx` anchor keeps `box.right - control.left` constant across a BOX
// resize for a fixed N (the button's left edge moves exactly as much as the
// box's right edge does), so a box-only resize needs no recompute — but the
// control's own SIZE changes (the label/glyph swap `boxWide` drives, a
// platform's longer/shorter label, a font or zoom change) do, and only
// observing the control catches exactly that. Both elements are still
// tracked (not just observed) because the delta is measured fresh off both
// rects every time either ref (re)attaches — see below for why identity
// changes, not just resizes, have to trigger a recompute too.
//
// Callback refs on BOTH elements, same reasoning as `useWidthThresholdRef`
// above: the box this attaches to is `SearchField.tsx`'s
// `.listing-search-box`, which this same component already documents as
// getting torn down and rebuilt on a portal swap into the crumb bar
// (search-slot.ts) — an object ref plus a mount-only effect would freeze on
// whichever node existed at first commit and never notice the swap. The
// control is the shortcut button itself, which additionally mounts and
// unmounts on its own schedule entirely independent of any portal (it only
// renders while `!pinnedOpen && !hasClear`) — a callback ref is the only
// thing that observes both kinds of churn uniformly.
//
// `onChange(null)` — not a stale number — is reported the moment either
// element is missing: on first paint before both refs have attached, on the
// button's own unmount (focus, or a query typed in), and on the box's
// unmount during a portal swap before the new box re-attaches. A caller that
// left the LAST measured value in place here would reserve room for a
// button that is no longer there, silently truncating the path for no
// reason — the exact failure mode this whole mechanism exists to avoid, just
// moved from "wrong estimate" to "stale measurement."
// THE DISAPPEARING-PATH DEFECT (running-screen review, 2026-09-13, measured
// live at 700x900 on a 124px `.listing-search-box`): `display: none` does
// NOT unmount `.listing-search-shortcut-hint` — only `!pinnedOpen &&
// !hasClear` in SearchField.tsx does that. The narrow-box container query in
// explorer.css (`@container (max-width: 189px) { .listing-search-shortcut-
// hint { display: none } }`) hides the button while leaving its ref
// attached to a node the layout engine has stopped placing. A hidden
// element's `getBoundingClientRect()` is an all-zero rect pinned at the
// origin, so the old `measure()` computed `box.right - 0 + gapPx` — a number
// on the order of the box's OWN distance from the viewport's left edge, not
// a button width. Measured concretely: a 124px box published a 214px
// reservation, larger than the box itself, which collapsed
// `.listing-search-crumbs`'s `right: max(...)` clearance past the box's
// full width and blanked the breadcrumb path down to bare icon — confirmed
// in a screenshot, invisible to every headless test in this file because
// jsdom's layout is a no-op (every rect is already zero) and so never
// distinguishes "hidden" from "not yet measured."
//
// `isLaidOut` below is the guard: `offsetParent === null` is the platform's
// own "does this participate in layout right now" check, true for
// `display: none` on the element OR any ancestor, and for a disconnected
// node — exactly the "not really there" cases a hidden-but-mounted control
// produces. (It is also null for `position: fixed`, but neither the box nor
// the button is ever fixed, so that caveat is moot here.) The zero-area
// rect check rides along as a second, independent signal: first paint,
// before the browser has laid either element out at all, can hand back a
// non-null `offsetParent` with a still-zero rect for exactly one frame
// (`getBoundingClientRect()` measuring a node the browser hasn't placed
// yet), and only the rect check catches that case.

// function of two rect-and-offsetParent-bearing objects so a test can hand
// it stubbed elements (a plain object with the two methods/properties
// `getBoundingClientRect`/`offsetParent` needs) without mounting real DOM —
// jsdom's own rects are always zero, which is exactly the degenerate input
// this function has to tell apart from a real hidden control, so a fake
// with a non-zero stubbed rect is the only way to test the "normal case"
