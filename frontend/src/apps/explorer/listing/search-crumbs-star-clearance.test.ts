// THE DEFECT (running-screen review, reported with a screenshot): in the
// merged crumb-bar omnibox, at rest (field NOT focused, crumbs showing), the
// bookmark star sat directly on top of the last crumb's text — the path
// `~ / Downloads / Archive` rendered with the star's tinted hover pill
// covering the last two letters of "Archive".
//
// Root cause: `.listing-search-crumbs` (explorer.css) reserves only
// `right: 10px` — enough to clear the box's own border, not the star, which
// sits at `right: 8px` in a 24px hit box
// (`#breadcrumb .crumb-search-slot .listing-search-box .bookmark-star-btn`).
// A short path never shows this because the crumbs are left-aligned, but
// PathCrumbs.tsx deliberately pins the strip's scrollLeft to its own END (so
// a narrow field keeps the CURRENT folder readable), which drives a long
// path's tail straight under the star.
//
// The fix reuses `--pin-right` (already 40px on
// `.crumb-search-slot .listing-search-box`, set for exactly this same star
// clearance so the count/spinner pin doesn't collide with it either) rather
// than inventing a second number for the same distance.
//
// Same CSS-parsing pattern as search-mode-chip.test.ts and
// search-count-pin-degrade.test.ts: read explorer.css as text (comments
// stripped) and assert on the selectors/declarations present — no container-
// query or layout engine in this suite's DOM to render against.
