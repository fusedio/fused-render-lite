// The preview pane (right-hand split): the usePreviewPane hook that owns the
// pane's width and its divider drag.
//
// **NO CONDITIONAL LAYOUT LOGIC LIVES HERE ANY MORE** (D282, the owner's "remove
// any complicated breakpoint logic"). Two generations of that are gone. First a
// user-facing on/off — a toggle button, a `?preview=true|false` URL param that
// rode along on directory navigation, and a `pane=0` viewstate key so a folder
// remembered being closed: three places to keep in agreement for one bit. Then the
// thing that replaced it, a **700px width gate** on the split container measured
// with a `ResizeObserver`, which decided whether there was a pane at all, plus
// 30/50/70 width tiers stepping on two more breakpoints.
//
// Now: the pane is there whenever this Listing is one that has a pane (the
// caller's `enabled` — not embedded, not a snapshot, not a panel pane), and it
// takes 30% of its container, the same share the file view's sidebar takes. There
// is no measurement, no threshold and no tier; a narrow window gets a narrow
// listing beside a floored pane, and `_side=off` is the way out of it, exactly as
// on a wide one.
//
// What SURVIVES from the old model is the width, and only the width: a dragged
// split is a real preference, unlike an on/off the layout can infer. But it is
// no longer remembered PER FOLDER, and no longer stored at all. It used to be a
// `panew` key in the per-path viewstate map, which meant the divider jumped on
// ordinary navigation — out of a folder you had dragged, into one you had not,
// and the pane snapped between your width and the default.
//
// **THE STORED WIDTH IS NOW THE FILE SIDEBAR'S** (D460): one pixel number, in
// `lib/side-store.ts`, shared by both surfaces for the life of the document — a
// drag on either carries over to the other. It used to be its own fraction, kept
// in `listing/pane-store.ts` (deleted), independently of the file view's pixel
// width; the two stores already shared the undragged DEFAULT (`companionFrac`,
// D283) and nothing else. `paneFracFromSharedWidth` (listing/pane-math.ts) is
// the seam: the shared pixel number, re-clamped into THIS pane's own (narrower)
// floors and turned into a fraction of this container. The reasoning for why a
// REFRESH deliberately clears it either way lives in `lib/side-store.ts`. Off
// the URL for the same reason as before: one machine's split isn't something a
// shared link should impose.
//
// Width is RENDERED as a FRACTION of the split container, a percentage
// flex-basis — so a pane keeps its proportion when the window resizes, which a
// resolved pixel width never did. UNDRAGGED it is `PANE_DEFAULT_FRAC`, a constant.
// The pixel floors survive as CSS min-widths (.listing-pane-slot /
// .listing-main) and as the drag's clamp; those are clamps, not breakpoints. The
// arithmetic itself is pure and lives in listing/pane-math.ts.

// Both are gone for good:
//   `panew`  the per-folder fraction, whose per-folder-ness was the bug (see
//            the header). It went session-wide first (its own module,

//            shared pixel store (D460, `lib/side-store.ts`) — left in this old
//            per-path storage it would do nothing except wait to be misread by
//            a later reader.
//   `pane`   the OFF choice from the model before that, which the old
//            savePaneWidth deleted opportunistically on its way past — i.e.
//            only for folders the user happened to drag again. This clears the
//            rest.
// Every user therefore starts on the adaptive default and keeps it until their
// next drag; nothing here can be translated into the new model, because a width
// chosen for one folder is not a statement about the session.
//

// sibling folders keep independent sorts), which is exactly why the purge names
// its params instead of clearing the map.
