// `has_index` splits the two scanning cases. An index that already exists keeps
// answering while a rescan runs (the last completed generation), so the user
// is told the results may lag. With no index yet the live walk is answering,
// so the same spinner means progress, not staleness.
//
// `behind` is the third message and the quiet one: no scan is running, but
// the file index itself moved since these results were computed (a completed
// scan bumping `useListingSearch.ts`'s lifecycle count — not a bare dir-watch
// event, which is background churn under the tree that says nothing about
// whether the index changed, and does not set this) and the search is
// deliberately not refetching (listing/revalidate — swapping the rows out
// from under someone reading them is worse than being a little behind). That
// trade is only defensible if it is stated, which is what this says. A
// running scan outranks it: "indexing…" already implies the same caveat and
// names the reason.
// `rescanPending` is the third input and the one with no poll behind it: this
// app just changed a file, the server has been told to rescan that folder
// (server/index_touch.py), and until a status poll catches the run, `scanning`
// is still false while the rows on screen are the ones that are wrong. It
// reads as the same "indexing…" because it is the same claim — results come
// from an index that is being put right — and it outranks `behind`, which says
// nothing is coming.
//
// `failed` is the fourth input: the request FOR THE QUERY NOW IN THE BOX
// errored, so the rows on screen answer whatever the last request that
// succeeded was asked. It outranks `behind`'s generic "not refreshed" —
// that phrasing promises a plain re-run will catch up, which is not what
// just happened here — but a running scan is still the more urgent claim
// when both are true, so it is checked first.

/**
 * The caveat for a box that asks the server per query.
 *
 * Both search boxes assemble the same three inputs, and the assembly is where
 * they got it wrong rather than in `indexCaveat` itself — which is why it is a
 * function now instead of an expression repeated at two call sites with a
 * test grepping for the word `pending`.
 *
 * `behind` — "these rows answer a different query, or an older generation of
 * the tree" — is two situations wearing one name. While a request is in
 * flight, or is merely scheduled and still sitting out the debounce before it
 * goes out, the next answer is at most a couple hundred ms away, and
 * captioning that "not refreshed… clear the search and run it again" is
 * corpus-staleness language for a round trip that has not even started yet.
 * `pending` covers both — armed the moment a request is scheduled, not only
 * once it is in flight — so this guard's window matches the whole wait, not
 * just its back half. Only rows that are STUCK are stale.
 *
 * `failed` — the request for the query now in the box errored, and the rows
 * on screen answer whatever the last request that succeeded was asked —
 * folds into the same `behind` question (`useListingSearch.ts`'s `behind`
 * is already true whenever `failed` is) but carries its own caption rather
 * than `indexCaveat`'s generic "not refreshed" one, which promises a plain
 * re-run will catch up. Optional: `FilesHome.tsx`'s own search can fail the
 * same way, but it already says so through its own `ErrorBanner` row rather
 * than this chip, so it never passes `failed` here.
