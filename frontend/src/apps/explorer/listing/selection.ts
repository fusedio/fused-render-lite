// folder's rows settle once per navigation, so that was a single shot. Results
// re-rank on every keystroke, on every stream flush and on every slice the scan

//
//   * nobody has claimed the selection -> the top hit, and it FOLLOWS the

//     typed past would leave the pane on a result that is no longer the best
//     answer, which is worse than not selecting at all.
//   * the user moved the selection -> leave it. Auto-select fills a selection
//     nobody chose; it never overrules one somebody did.

// enough to read in the address bar and keeps the fs path out of a link that
// already carries it in its pathname.
//
// One rule covers both view modes, because a search hit's row path is
// `base + "/" + entry.rel` exactly like a plain row's is `base + "/" + name` —
// so the param is always "the part after this folder", whether that is a name
// or a relative path several levels down.
//

// restored link needs; a range is a working state, not a destination.

// the folder you just left is the highlighted row, so the eye finds where it

// folder does not render. (`selParam`, the write side, keeps whole relative
// paths because a SEARCH hit really is a row of the folder it was found from.)
//

// What a press on a row does TO THE SELECTION — and nothing else, which is the
// point.
//
// The explorer has ONE press model: a press selects, and a plain RELEASE that
// never left the row (no drag, no sweep) opens it — on every row, in every
// listing, at every window width (D460, superseding the double-click rule
// below). It used to be double-click, and before that TWO models chosen by
// whether the preview pane happened to be showing — pane off, a single click
// selected AND opened; pane on, it only selected and a double click opened.
// Both were defensible only while a click had to leave room for a plain press
// to ALSO preview the row via the selection (the pane used to follow the
// selection): a single click that navigated away would have made that preview
// unreachable for exactly the rows it was most useful on. D460 deleted that
// coupling — the pane now shows the open folder's own companions and never the
// selection (see `listing/pane-side.ts`) — so there is nothing left for a
// single click to preserve by not opening, and the double-click detour (itself
// a fix for an even older bug: the same click opening or not depending on how
// wide the window happened to be, listing/pane.ts) goes with it.
//
// THIS IS DECIDED ON POINTERDOWN, not on click, and that is not a detail. Rows
// are drag sources, and on a `draggable` element WebKit does not reliably
// deliver the `click` that would have followed the press — which is how
// Shift/Cmd-click went silently dead once, and how a plain click on parts of a
// row could fail to select at all. Deciding on the press removes the entire
// failure class rather than working around it, and it is what Finder and
// Explorer do: the highlight lands while the button is still down. OPENING is
// decided on the RELEASE instead (Listing's onRowPointerUp): a `select` or
// `defer` press that lets go without passing the drag slop opens the row: a
// `toggle`/`extend` (modified) press never does, because a Shift/Mod click
// means "add this to my selection", not "take me there".
//
// The four answers:
//
//   toggle  Mod down: add/remove this row, re-anchoring on it.
//   extend  Shift down: the range from the anchor to this row.
//   select  the ordinary press: this row alone, immediately.
//   defer   a plain press on a row that is ALREADY part of a MULTI-selection.
//           The one case that cannot be answered on the press: collapsing to
//           the pressed row there would make a multi-row drag impossible, since
//           every drag begins with a press on one of the rows being dragged.
//           So it waits for the release, and collapses only if the press never
//           became a drag or a sweep. A press on a row that is the ONLY
//           selected row needs no deferral — "select" is already what it is.
//
// `mod` is the caller's isMod(e) verdict rather than the raw event, so the rule
// stays pure and platform-free (isMod is exclusive per-platform by design; see
// lib/platform). Mod outranks Shift when both are down: the toggle is the more
// precise gesture, and a stray Shift while Mod-picking rows must not replace
// the picks with a range. Both outrank `inMultiSelection`, because a modified
// press is never the start of a plain drag of the selection.
