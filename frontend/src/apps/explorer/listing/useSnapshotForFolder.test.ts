// Regression coverage for code review finding B5: Listing.tsx's snapshot
// resolution used to key its effect on `[fsPath]` alone, so a commit
// selection made through a plain `replaceSearch` (which does not dispatch
// `fused:navigate`, only `fused:urlchange`) never re-ran it while the open
// folder itself stayed put. Driven through the real hook via the listing's
// own render harness (hook-harness.ts — react-test-renderer, no DOM), not
// grepped: what matters is which resolution the hook actually holds after a
// URL change, not the shape of the source that decides it.
//
// `urlVersion` is passed to the hook directly (what Listing.tsx feeds it from
// `useUrlVersion()`) rather than driven through a real `window` event
// dispatch — this environment has neither a DOM nor main.tsx's own wrapping
// of `history.replaceState` that a live browser would have, and the fix
// itself is entirely in how the hook reacts to that number changing, not in
// how the number gets produced (already covered by `useUrlVersion`'s own
// listeners in platform/lib/hooks.ts).
//
// `globalThis.location`/`.history` are NEVER HELD IN A LOCAL VARIABLE across
// an `await` — always re-read fresh (`curLoc()`/`curHist()`) at the exact
// point they are needed. Several OTHER suites sharing this process (e.g.
// Listing.test.tsx's own `useDirListing` tests) install a THROWAWAY
// `globalThis.location` object per test; when this file's own async
// (`await flush()`) tests happen to interleave with one of those, a `const
// loc = globalThis.location` captured before the `await` goes stale the
// moment another file's object takes its place — production code (which
// always reads the bare `location`/`history` identifiers fresh) then writes
// to a DIFFERENT object than the one this test still holds a reference to,
// and a `search` value silently stops updating with no test failure that
// points at the real cause. Reading fresh sidesteps that regardless of
// which object is currently installed.
