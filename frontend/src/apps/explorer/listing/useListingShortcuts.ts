// Keyboard shortcuts scoped to the listing: file operations on the selection
// plus the folder-level navigation chords. Registered once (empty deps); the
// handler is re-assigned each render so it always reads fresh state/closures.
// Separate from the nav handler (useListingSelection), and non-overlapping
// with it by construction: everything here carries the primary modifier or is
// a key that handler ignores (F2, Delete, Backspace — its printable-key branch
// only fires for single-character keys, and its arrow branch bails when
// isMod(e)).
//
// WHICH chord is which lives in listing/shortcut-chord.ts (pure, tested); this
// file is the wiring and the "is there anything to act on" half. The split is
// what makes the exact-modifier rule testable — see that file for the
// Ctrl+Shift+C hijack it exists to prevent.
