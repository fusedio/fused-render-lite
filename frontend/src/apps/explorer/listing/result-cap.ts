// Scoring and ranking still run over the ENTIRE corpus — this caps the list,
// not the search. Past the first hundred a fuzzy rank has stopped saying
// anything the user can act on, and the useful move is a better query rather
// than more scrolling, so the tail is not rendered and the counter says how
// much it is not showing. That is also why there is no "load more": offering
// one would answer the wrong question. The counter states the fact and stops
// there — telling the user to "refine your search" is instruction, not
// information, and they can see the number for themselves.
//
// The count stays TRUE. Reporting the capped number would be a lie about the
// folder, and the whole point of the message is to tell the user how much they
// are not seeing.

 * matches — while all equally relevant, with no ranking tail to trim — can
 * still number in the thousands over a broad enough pattern, which is the
 * same "too many rows for a screen" problem the cap exists to solve either
 * way. `mode` stays a parameter (rather than dropped entirely) because the
 * two shapes are still asked of the server at different fetch limits
 * (SEARCH_RANK_LIMIT / SEARCH_GLOB_RANK_LIMIT) — this function does not need
 * to know which, but callers and tests still name the shape they are

 * the two truncations are independent and both are true at once on a large
 * tree. Both query shapes own up to the display cap identically now, so
 * `mode` no longer changes which branch fires here — it stays on the
