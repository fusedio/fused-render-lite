// The listing preview pane's THREE COMPANIONS and the `_side` param that records
// which one is showing — plus a `preview` FALLBACK that is not on offer. Pure and
// DOM-free, like the pane's other decision modules (pane-math, pane-modes), so the
// semantics below can be pinned by a test with no router and no React.
//
// **THE PANE IS A COMPANION COLUMN, NOT A PREVIEW SPLIT** (D285). That is the frame
// for everything here, and it took four decisions to arrive at because it was
// discovered rather than designed: D280 took away the folder's rendered PAGE, D281 a
// selected folder's preview, D284 the no-selection state's, and D285 the last one —
// a FILE row's. Each was reported as its own bug ("we don't want rendering", "the
// preview template in the dropdown when nothing is selected is wrong", "we do not
// want preview template in the sidebar for the file previews either"), and the
// through-line only reads clearly from the end: the column beside a listing is for
// things that TALK ABOUT what you are looking at, not for a second copy of it.
//
// **This makes the pane agree with the full-screen file sidebar, which was
// companions-only from the start** (`lib/preview-side.ts` over
// `mode-visibility.SIDEBAR_MODES` = `["claude", "git"]` — no `preview`
// side, ever).
// The listing pane was the odd one out, and the four decisions above are it
// converging on the shape the other half of the app already had.
//
//   claude   the chat, `chat_only=1`, about the OPEN FOLDER — never the
//            selected row (D460: the pane stopped reading the selection at
//            all, so `claude`'s subject is the same folder `git`/`mcp`'s is).
//   git      the OPEN FOLDER's working tree — not the row's. See dir-mode.ts:
//            a working tree belongs to the folder, so `git` is bound to the
//            universal "/" key alone and the pane borrows the folder's entry.
//   (mcp     the OPEN FOLDER's MCP tools was a third mode here for a while.
//            Folder-bound for the same shape of reason as `git`, but it is a
//            DIALOG off the search row's kebab now — EntryActionsMenu →
//            McpDialog — not a pane mode.)
//
//   preview  **NOT SELECTABLE, and not in the switcher.** It survives as the
//            pane's internal FALLBACK for one state: neither companion offered (a
//            mount-backed folder, where both gates refuse), where the pane must
//            still render something. There it shows a plain FOLDER-scoped hint —
//            no row, no template, nothing selection-shaped (D460 deleted the
//            row-preview machinery `pane-modes.ts` used to feed this branch). It
//            is a state the pane falls into, never a mode a user picks, which is
//            why `PANE_SIDE_MODES` still carries it (the fallback needs the type)
//            while `paneSideMenu` never draws a row for it and `paneSideList`
//            yields it only as that last resort.
//
// Closed at these three, and a per-ROW companion is deliberately not a fourth:
// over a folder the thing you are looking at is a LIST, so a column that talks
// about one row is a pill for a view nobody browses into. Anything of that shape
// stays one click away — open the row, and the file sidebar has it. **All three
// are folder-bound now** (D460) — every mode's subject, key and `_file` target
// is the OPEN FOLDER, never the selection, so there is no per-row/per-folder
// split left to ask `isFolderBoundSide` about.
//
// This also RETIRES the pane's old per-template switcher (`_panelMode`), which
// offered every mode the selected row resolved — image/photos/pano for a .png,
// and `claude` among them. Two mode controls over one row is the thing
// the bars' grammar has been converging away from (see Preview's headerActions on
// why a folder has no top-bar switcher), and the companions are not row views at
// all, which is the whole premise of the split. What is genuinely lost is picking
// a NON-DEFAULT content template for a previewed row inside the pane; the
// expand button opens the row full-screen, where the content switcher lives.

// from the width of the split (pane.ts). Reading absence as "closed" would turn
// every existing folder URL, bookmark and recent into a one-column listing.
//
// **THE FILE PREVIEW'S SIDEBAR NOW READS IT THE SAME WAY** (D326, `lib/
// preview-side.ts`), and this block used to be the statement of the asymmetry
// instead: file absent = CLOSED ("the sidebar is an extra beside a content view
// that is already complete on its own, so nothing is the same as nothing"), folder
// absent = OPEN. The asymmetry is gone, and by the file half moving — its rule made
// the sidebar's presence a stored PREFERENCE, which the per-file session sidecar
// then replayed forever. `_side=off` and everything below is one vocabulary across
// both surfaces now, so a param carried between them means the same thing in both
// directions; the one thing that still differs is what "the first companion on
// offer" resolves to, because a folder and a file offer different things.
//
// **Absence is `mode: null`, not a named mode**, and that is the change D285 forced.
// It used to mean `preview`, which was safe only while `preview` was universally
// offered; once no subject offers it, an absent param resolving to it meant the pill
// naming a mode the pane would then fall back OUT of. Null says "no choice yet" and
// lets `activePaneSide` answer against what this folder actually offers — so a clean
// URL lands on Claude, and on Git in a folder whose chat is refused.
//
// Which is why closing is `_side=off` and not a deleted param: the two states an
// absent param could mean are not the same here, so the SHUT one has to say so.
// **The mode that is on offer first gets the CLEAN URL** (PT-9's rule — selecting
// the default deletes the param — now reading "Claude gets the clean URL"): the ONE
// writer normalises a pick of the leading companion to `null` (Listing's
// `selectSide`), so choosing the mode you are already on cannot grow a param, and
// only a deliberate second choice (`_side=git`) is written down.
//

// keeps the param across a DIRECTORY hop), lands open on the leading companion. Same
// silent fallback an unknown `_mode` gets. **`_side=preview` is one of those unknown
// values now** — it names a state the pane can only fall into, so a hand-typed or
// carried-in one is refused here rather than resolving to the fallback and pinning

// listing peek is the listing already on the left; the "Select a file to preview."
// hint was a non-answer over a non-previewable subject). A FILE row lost it because
// the pane is a companion column, full stop — the same shape the full-screen file
// sidebar has always had. So there is nothing left for the subject to change, and
// the parameter that asked went with the question.
//
// **Unless neither companion is offered** (a mount-backed folder: both gates
// refuse), when `preview` comes back as the fallback. The pane must show something,

// file row's own default template, or the metadata card.
//
// **A PROBE STILL OUT IS NOT A DENIAL, and the answer is then NEITHER — an EMPTY
// LIST, meaning UNDECIDED.** `Listing` nulls both entries while `lib/dir-mode`
// resolves them, so "no companion offered" and "not answered yet" arrive in the same
// shape; taking the `preview` fallback there was the bug 7c37acf4 fixed — the pill
// reading "Preview" while a chat rendered under it, then a remount and a SECOND
// `agent.py` spawn when the verdict landed.
//
// **UNDECIDED NOW INCLUDES "ONLY THE FOLLOWER HAS LANDED"** (D326), which is why the
// wait below is keyed on `claudePending` before anything is offered at all: the two
// probes are independent, so Git answering first is ordinary, and offering Git alone
// meanwhile put the pane on it and then jumped to Claude the moment its verdict
// arrived — `activePaneSide` reads the live list every render. A denial is still a
// decision (Git then leads what is left); only an unanswered LEADER is a wait. So the caller holds a SKELETON on an
// empty list: no mode resolved, nothing mounted, one spawn when the answer arrives.
// (`paneSideMenu` reads this same list, so it draws its companions as CT-12 spinners
// meanwhile.)
//
// **A FILE ROW IS NO LONGER EXEMPT FROM THAT WAIT, and this is a deliberate, stated
// cost.** It used to be: its `preview` was its own template list, which the folder's
// companion gates say nothing about, so waiting would have been a skeleton over an
// answer already in hand. That exemption's premise is gone with the offer — there is
// no side to resolve for a file row until the probe answers either. The cost is
// bounded by the probe being **per FOLDER, not per row** (`useDirMode` is keyed on
// the folder and caches per directory): the window opens once per folder open, so
// arrow-keying between file rows afterwards never re-enters it. The one visible case
