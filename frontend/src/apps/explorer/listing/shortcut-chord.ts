// useListingShortcuts, so the chord table can be tested without a DOM or a
// React renderer (the frontend test setup has neither). The tests live in
// shortcut-chord.test.ts, which also keeps the source guard on the reload
// chord that used to be this table's only test.
//
// THE RULE THIS FILE EXISTS TO ENFORCE: a chord matches on its EXACT modifiers,
// never on "at least these". The hook used to test `mod && key === "c"` against
// a lowercased `e.key`, so Ctrl+SHIFT+C matched — and Ctrl+Shift+C is devtools'
// inspect-element on Linux/Windows and the terminal copy chord besides. The
// handler took it and called preventDefault, so the browser binding never ran
// and the user's inspector stopped opening. Every entry below therefore spells
// out the modifiers it does NOT want, and anything unmatched returns null so the
// caller leaves the event alone for whoever else wants it.
