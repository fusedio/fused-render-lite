// The preview pane's width arithmetic, as pure functions: the split threshold,
// the undragged breakpoints, the pixel clamps, and the divider drag's
// px→fraction step. The stateful half — the hook and the drag — lives in
// pane.ts.
//
// There is no parse of a stored width here, and there was: a dragged fraction
// used to be serialised into the per-folder viewstate and read back, so it
// needed validating on the way in (legacy pixel values, a whole-container 1).
// Nothing is stored per-folder any more — see the next paragraph for what is.
//
// **THE STORED WIDTH IS PIXELS, SHARED WITH THE FILE SIDEBAR** (D460,
// `lib/side-store.ts`) — a change from this pane's own history, where a
// dragged FRACTION lived in `listing/pane-store.ts` (now deleted) independently
// of the file view's pixel-based sidebar. `paneFracFromSharedWidth` below is
// the seam: it takes the shared pixel number and this pane's OWN floors and
// share ceiling (`clampSharedPaneWidth` — the floors narrower than the file
// sidebar's, since a listing column tolerates less room than a chat
// composer) and answers the fraction THIS container should render, so the
// two surfaces can share one stored number while keeping different floors.
// `dragPaneFrac` reads back through the exact same clamp, so a LOCAL drag on
// this pane and an imported width are bounded identically — see
// `MAX_PANE_SHARE`'s own comment for why that turned out to be the fix rather
// than capping only the imported path. Everywhere else in this module, width
// is still a FRACTION of the split container: that is what keeps the pane
// proportional when the window resizes (see pane.ts), and pixels appear only
// as the floors, the shared stored value, and the duration of a drag.
//
// It is a separate module for a testability reason, not a tidiness one:
// pane.ts imports @platform/lib/router, which reads `location` at MODULE INIT
// (its embed-prefix constant), so merely importing pane.ts in a DOM-free bun
// test throws. Splitting the math out is the cleaner of the two fixes —
// deferring the router's read would make a genuinely load-time constant lazy
// for every caller in the app to suit a test, whereas this arithmetic never
// wanted the router in the first place.

// container), which was believed enough for a drag performed ON this
// container, where the cursor is visibly the thing choosing the number. It
// is not: the pixel number can now arrive from SOMEWHERE ELSE too (the file
// sidebar's own drag, D460) — the file sidebar's ceiling is `containerW -
// CONTENT_MIN_W` on whatever monitor it was dragged on, which can be a much
// bigger pixel count than this container has ever seen, and reading it back
// through the pixel floors alone would open this listing at its 60px sliver
// — or, across an ordinary window resize (this container shrinking under a
// WIDTH that no longer moves with it, since the stored number is pixels and
// not a proportion), squeeze it there without any drag at all.
//
// A SHARE ceiling bounds the fraction directly, on top of the pixel floors,
// so a number chosen for a different container — or for this one, before it
// shrank — can never starve the list beyond what the design ever intends a
// companion column to take. **It applies uniformly, to `dragPaneFrac` and
// `paneFracFromSharedWidth` alike, through the one function both now call
// (`clampSharedPaneWidth` below)** — the alternative, capping only the
// IMPORTED path and leaving a local drag free to reach the old ~94% pixel-
// floor ceiling, was rejected: the render already re-derives its fraction
// from the STORED pixel number on every commit (`pane.ts`), so a local drag
// that reached past the cap while dragging and an import that started there
// would be indistinguishable one render later — "was this number dragged
// here or somewhere else" is not a fact this module (or the shared store) can
// answer, and a value that is capped when read back but not when written is
// exactly the mismatch the second review pass caught: the divider detaching
// from the cursor mid-drag, and a stored width the very next render disagreed
// with.

//   2. never narrower than `PANE_MIN_W`, EVEN IF that disagrees with rule 1.
//
// Floor-last is not a stylistic choice: below ~314px (`PANE_MIN_W /
// MAX_PANE_SHARE`) the share ceiling alone would ask for fewer pixels than
// the pane's own floor — 322px of a 460px container, for instance — and
// `.listing-pane-slot`'s CSS `min-width: 220px` would then override the
// flex-basis, so the rendered layout and the fraction this function answered
// would disagree. Applying the floor SECOND, unconditionally, is
// what `clampPaneWidth` already did for the pixel floors alone; this keeps
// that guarantee once a share ceiling is in the mix too. In that narrow band
// the floor simply wins outright — the pane is wider than `MAX_PANE_SHARE`
// of its container there, exactly as it always was before the cap existed,

// this session) answers the plain companion share.
//
// The shared number is clamped into THIS pane's OWN floors AND share ceiling

// composer (the file sidebar's 380px floor) is still valid input here, just
// re-clamped against this pane's own — which is now the same kind of number,

// `clampSharedPaneWidth` returns PANE_MIN_W regardless of input, which is
// more pixels than the container has, and dividing it out yields a fraction
// over 1 (`flexBasis: "110%"`) — a number CSS cannot render sanely and that
// `dragPaneFrac` itself refuses to produce (it answers `null` there, and the
// caller changes nothing). This module has no `null` to hand back — a
// fraction always renders — so it hands back the one number that was always
// the answer for an unmeasurable or unsplittable container anyway.

//     panel-split grid, a zoomed-in window). There the clamp returns

//     is exactly 1.0, "the pane takes everything", which no wider window can
