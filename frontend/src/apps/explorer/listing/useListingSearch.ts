// The in-folder search: query state (URL-synced), and the ranked answer from
// the index.
//
// A non-empty query (at least MIN_QUERY_CHARS long — the same gate the home
// page's box uses, lib/home-search) swaps the listing for flat, rank-ordered
// results over the whole subtree — UNLESS the query is path-shaped and
// glob-free (`isPathQuery`, path-shaped-query.ts), in which case no request
// is ever issued at all: the completion dropdown already answers that query
// on its own (`useCompletion.ts`), and a rank request behind the same text
// would only echo it back with a count nobody asked for. WHERE those results
// come from, when they do run, is the
// server's call, never this file's: `GET /api/index/rank` filters and ranks
// in the index and says WHY when it cannot yet (listing/index-source). A
// folder no scan will ever cover — a remote mount, a package, one the ignore
// list excludes — comes back with a `reason` this hook hands to the caller
// unchanged; the caller renders it as the same index gap the home page's box
// already shows for the same reasons (lib/home-search's `indexGap`).
//
// An uncovered folder — a remote mount, a package, one the ignore list
// excludes — asks for an on-demand scan and polls while it runs
// (listing/index-source), and a folder that stays uncovered, or that no scan
// will ever cover in the first place, settles for the index's own answer
// about itself: there is no second, browser-scored path that walks the
// filesystem directly. Every rule phase 1 established for the home page's box
// applies here for the same reason it always did (platform/lib/instant-
// search): a trailing debounce, abort rather than queue, answer a backspace
// from memory — and NEVER blank the list. The previous query's rows stay on
// screen, dimmed and captioned, until the next answer lands.
//
// Neither the ranked answer nor the scan poll re-fetches on background churn.
// A dir-watch event elsewhere under the folder is RECORDED, and the results
// stay put — silently, since nothing about the index this query was answered
// from has moved — until a boundary where a repaint costs the user nothing:
// the search ending, or a change this app itself made. See listing/revalidate.
// A completed scan is different: the fetch effect re-asks for it directly
// (its key includes the index lifecycle count), so it is what "not
// refreshed" actually describes — an answer whose index has since moved and
// has not yet been repainted over it.
