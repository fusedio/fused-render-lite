// Two modes offered SIDE BY SIDE may never be indistinguishable.
//
// This is a test about registry BINDINGS, not about wording: which modes a key
// carries together is what decides whether a collision is even possible, and
// that is decided in `fused_render/templates/registry.json` and in the preview
// pane's own list (`listing/pane-modes.ts`). The display names themselves are
// `platform/lib/mode-name.ts`'s business and are unit-tested there — nothing
// here asserts a particular label.
//
// The bug that motivated the guard: two timeline templates — a sidecar-backed
// one and a git-backed one — both read "History", and `.parquet` and `.html`
// each carried BOTH modes, so the Open With menu (`lib/fs-actions.ts`, `label:
// modeTitle(t.mode)`) and every mode menu drew two identical entries pointing
// at different templates. Dispatch keys on `mode`, so nothing broke — the user
// simply could not tell which was which.
//
// That particular pair is gone rather than papered over: the sidecar one was
// deleted, and the git-backed survivor went too once the `git` view covered the
// same ground. The guard stays because the collision it catches is structural,
// not about that pair.
//
// The guard is general on purpose: a collision is created by an edit SOMEWHERE
// ELSE — adding a mode to a key, or naming a new template folder into a string
// the humanizer already produces — so pinning the one pair would not catch the
// next.

//     folder row now offers the companions alone (D281, pane-side.test.ts covers
//     it, including that a hand-typed `?_side=preview` resolves onward instead of
//     resurrecting it);
//   * every list of TEMPLATE modes: the full-screen topbar menu, the panel/tab
//     pane menus (PaneModeMenu), the Open With menu, and this pane's row modes.
//     Those render `modeTitle(mode)`, and no mode a directory resolves humanizes
//     to "Preview" — `_listing` is "Listing", which is why the full-screen route
//     keeps a plainly-named way to the file table.
//
// So the second bullet is a no-op TODAY and this is what keeps it one: the guard
// reads the shipped registry, so binding a `preview` template back onto a
// directory key — the deleted D185 folder-preview template's own name, the most
// likely way it returns — fails here instead of in a user's dropdown.
