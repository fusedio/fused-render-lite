// How a git status becomes a decoration on a listing row: the class the name is
// tinted through, and the one-letter badge beside it.
//
// The BADGE is not decoration on the decoration. Colour is the whole signal in
// VS Code's file tree, and colour alone excludes anyone who cannot separate the
// green from the amber — roughly one reader in twelve for the commonest form of
// colour-vision deficiency, which is exactly the added/modified pair. The
// letter says the same thing without the hue, and its tooltip says it in words
// for a screen reader.
//
// Letters follow git's own porcelain vocabulary rather than our state names, so
// they mean the same thing here as in `git status` — `U` for untracked (`??`),
// `M` for a dirty work tree, `S` for staged-and-clean, `!` for an unresolved
// merge. `A` is deliberately unused: git spells the STAGED add `A`, and lending
// that letter to "untracked" would make the two states swap names between the
// listing and the terminal.

 * a row is never tinted without its badge, or badged without its tint.
