// The shell half of the preview pane's focus contract (platform/lib/frame-focus.ts
// states it): keep the keyboard on the listing when a preview mounts.
//
// runtime.js asks every rendered page not to take focus, which is the half that
// covers templates nobody has written yet. This is the door guard behind it,
// and it is not belt-and-braces so much as the load-bearing half, for two
// reasons a browser makes plain:
//
//   • `autofocus` is applied BY THE BROWSER, from a candidate queued when the
//     element is inserted — removing the attribute afterwards does not dequeue
//     it, so no amount of cooperation inside the page can reliably beat it;
//   • focus landing on an element INSIDE the frame leaves the parent's
//     activeElement on the <iframe> itself. Blurring the inner element from in
//     there would not give the keyboard back to the shell — only blurring the
//     frame ELEMENT, from out here, does.
//
// Taking it back is that blur, and nothing more: it returns document focus to
// <body>, which is precisely the state the listing's document-level arrow-key
// handler requires (useListingSelection's `navActive`). Focusing a listing row
// instead would be worse — rows are not focusable, and focusing the search
// input would start swallowing the arrows itself.
//
// The pane is SAME-ORIGIN, which is what makes all of this possible: the guard
// listens inside the frame's own document for the two things it cannot learn
// from outside — that the frame took focus, and that the USER is the one who
// reached in. Events do not cross an iframe boundary, so a click inside the
// preview raises nothing in the shell; without listening in there, the guard
// would keep snatching focus back from a user who had deliberately clicked into
// the preview to type.
//
// Scoped to ONE preview: the pane component is keyed on the previewed path, so
// this hook remounts with the frame it guards and "has the user reached into
// the pane" resets when the preview does.

// already false for a disabled control, for `tabindex="-1"`, and for an anchor
// without an href, so the selector only has to be generous. Elements with no
// client rects are skipped as the browser skips them — that covers `display:
// none` chrome, including the pane that is not there on a narrow window.

// Read fresh on the keypress rather than cached: it is one querySelectorAll per
// Tab over a document of chrome, and any cache would be a second, staler
// account of a DOM that changes with every preview.
