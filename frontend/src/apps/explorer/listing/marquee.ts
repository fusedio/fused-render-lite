// SWEEP TO SELECT: press on a row's dead space or on the listing background,
// drag, and every row the swept region crosses becomes selected. Pure geometry
// — the pointer wiring is useMarquee.ts.
//
// The region is a HIT TEST first: `marqueeBox` is what `marqueeHits` intersects
// against, and neither of those knows about pixels on screen, only about the
// scroller's content space. `bandRect` is the one function here that DOES know
// about a picture — it turns that same region into the CSS rect the rubber
// band is drawn from (useMarquee, imperatively, so the drag costs no
// re-render). One region, one hit test, one rectangle: what is drawn and what
// is selected can never disagree, because both come from the same box.
//
// The gesture is split from the row drag by WHERE THE PRESS LANDS — decided
// once, at pointerdown, from the selection as it stood BEFORE the press
// (drag-drop's pressStartsDrag) and never re-asked. A row that was already
// selected starts a move-drag; EVERYTHING else sweeps — any part of an
// unselected row, and the background. Neither can turn into the other
// mid-gesture. A press that never travels MARQUEE_DRAG_SLOP is neither: it is
// the press that selects one row (selection's rowPressAction), and its
// release opens it (D460). The same slop decides for the move-drag too, so
// there is one threshold in the listing and not three.
//
// Router-free and DOM-free for the same reason pane-math.ts is: these are the
// only decisions the wiring makes, and a headless test can see them only if
// they import nothing that reads `location` at module init.

// grows `scrollHeight` by the overshoot, which is exactly the number the edge
// auto-scroll loop (useMarquee's scrollLoop) reads to decide whether it moved
