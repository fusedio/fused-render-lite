// The file view's half of the merged field (SearchField.tsx) — mounted over
// every plain file that owns the explorer's crumb bar (Preview.tsx, gated the
// same way `usePreviewFileMenu`'s own `ownsBar` is: `actionsInTopbar &&
// !stat.is_dir`).
//
// No complex logic: this box does not search. It carries the same query
// state SearchField needs (`useListingSearch`, `useTypedPathAddress`,
// `useCompletion` — the identical hooks the folder view calls, aimed at the
// file's PARENT folder instead of the file itself) purely to drive the box's
// own interaction — the completion dropdown, Enter, the commit gate — and the
// moment that gate opens (Enter for an escaping path, or immediately for a
// plain filter/glob that never leaves the folder), it navigates to the parent
// with the query attached (`navigate`'s `opts.q`) and stops. The parent
// folder's own Listing is what actually searches, seeded already-committed
// (`navHintQCommitted`, router.ts) so it never asks for a second Enter.
//
// `useListingSearch(parentPath, home, 0, false, undefined, false)` — the
// first `false` is `urlSync`: this box's query is never mirrored onto the
// file's own URL (that belongs to no view here), and the effect below fires
// before the hook's own fetch ever would (a `useLayoutEffect`, ahead of the
// hook's passive-effect request), so no rank request goes out against the
// parent while this file's page is still the one on screen. The trailing
// `false` is `fireEmptyScan` (code review finding 1): this instance never
// renders a result, only decides when to hand off to the parent folder's own
// Listing, which runs its own `useListingSearch` — with the trigger fully
// wired (`onScanRequested`, the "still building" copy) — the moment
// navigation lands. Letting THIS instance also fire the covered-but-empty
// scan trigger would ask the server to scan the same root a second time for
// no UI anyone would see.

  // Landing on `gateOpen` (not `committed`, which additionally waits for an
