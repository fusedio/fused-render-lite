// The home search's callout for `IndexGap === "fda"`: the packaged mac app has
// no Full Disk Access, so no index scan may start (shell/index_gate.py), so
// there is nothing to search. The one thing the user can do about it is grant
// the access, which is what this offers — in the `.fh-index-cta` slot the
// "Index my files" button uses for the buildable case, because it is the same
// kind of thing: the single action this screen asks for.
//
// Reads the shared FDA store (platform/lib/fda.ts) rather than rendering
// FdaStrip: the strip shows itself only after a REFUSED read, and nothing here
// was refused — nothing was even attempted. Same three faces as the wizard's
// FdaStep: open Settings; the grant landed and a relaunch remains
// (`pending_relaunch`); granted (which this process can only see after that
// relaunch, so in practice the callout is gone by then — the startup scan has
// begun and the gap reads `scanning`).
//
// Also the card Preferences > Indexing shows for the same gate: there the
// server answers a Re-index with 409 "indexing needs Full Disk Access on
// macOS", which named the wall and offered no door. Same callout, indexing
// wording (`copy`), same one action.
