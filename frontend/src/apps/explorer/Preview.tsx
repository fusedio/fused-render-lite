  // idiom `_fusedSnapshotSelected` above uses for `_snapshot`.
  //
  // THIS IS A PULL, NOT A PARAM ON THE SRC (review #804 round 2). It used to be
  // the latter — a `_fused_ask` query baked into the claude iframe's URL, kept
  // one-shot by a cache keyed on "has the src's own base changed" — and that
  // shape had a hole no amount of caching closed: ANY remount of that iframe
  // for a reason that has NOTHING to do with a new ask (toggling the sidebar to
  // `git` and back, closing and reopening the folder pane, a panel/tab
  // reattaching) rebuilds the exact same cached src and replays the ask into a
  // brand-new conversation. A `src` is an ADDRESS; "visit this document, but
  // only follow this part of the address the first time" is not a thing a URL
  // can express, however the cache around it is shaped.
  //
  // So the prompt lives here as plain in-memory state instead, and the CLAUDE
  // TEMPLATE pulls it at its own boot (`window._fusedClaudeAskTake`, called
  // through the claude template's `_fusedTakeClaudeAsk` export — see

  // This state exists to force exactly that remount: bumped on every incoming

  // synchronously, essentially always before a fresh network round trip
  // could complete, so a pane opened at commit X rendered TODAY's file for

  // resolve against — GET /render
  // (server/routers/render.py) has no `_snapshot` awareness of its own, so
  // an app previewed as ITSELF used to show its LIVE document body and
  // script under an active snapshot, with only the `fused.*` calls that
  // document's own script made resolving against the commit — two eras
  // mixed in one frame (finding A1, the feature's headline claim). Once the
  // src already addresses the extracted entry, there is nothing left for the
  // runtime to re-resolve for this frame's OWN document, and no race to lose
  // — which is what collapses A1 into the same fix as B1 rather than a
  // second, separate one. Ordinary template entries need no equivalent
  // rewrite of `path`/`_file`: that param always names the reader's own

      {/* One mode control per view, and for an explorer FOLDER it is the
          preview pane's, not this one. The pane header carries a ModeMenu of
          its own beside the previewed row (ListingPreviewPane), so a folder
          browsed in the explorer had two switchers in view at once — one
          top-right, one a few hundred pixels below it — and telling which
          governed which half is not something a user should have to work out.
          The pane's is the one that stays: it sits with the thing it changes.
          Files keep this control (they have no pane). The app view had a third
          answer here — it kept this control, because under its own route the
          folder was the whole subject rather than a listing beside a preview —
          and that route is gone, so a folder is a folder wherever you reached
          it from.
          Getting back out of one of the non-listing modes is the BROWSER'S
          BACK button, and deliberately nothing else (owner call). A folder
          only ever enters those modes by navigating — a typed `?_mode=`, a
          bookmark, Open With — so the navigation that got the user there is
          the thing that undoes it, and it is already at the top of the window.
          This view carried a floating "Browse contents" chip for that state
          for one release; over a template that draws its own header row it sat
          on the content and read as a stray tooltip rather than as a way out.
          A control that has to be explained is worse than the standard one
          every user already has.
          ACCEPTED TRADEOFF, and this part IS the product decision: nothing
          switches a folder's own `_mode` from the explorer any more. The pane's
          menu writes `_side` — which of the PANE's three the pane is showing
          (Preview / Claude / Git, listing/pane-side.ts) — and the chip only ever
          offers the listing⇄counterpart pair. So a folder's other `_mode`
          views (`graph`, say) are entered by URL (a bookmark, the file menu's Open
          With) and left by the chip. The user chose that over two switchers in one
          view: for a folder, the pane IS the explorer, and its peers are opt-in
          tools rather than ways of looking at the listing.
          Two of those peers came BACK as pane modes rather than as `_mode` views,
          and that is the same call rather than a reversal: the pane's Claude and
          Git sit beside the listing instead of replacing it, so they are
          companions to browsing the folder — which is exactly the argument the
          file sidebar makes one level down. */}

                     the whole of it: the claude sidebar looks this attribute up
                     through `parent.document` and treats the frame it marks as the
                     document its notes point at — see
                     fused_render/templates/claude/template.html (the annotate
                     target seam). Nothing here knows what annotation is, and the
                     template stays host-agnostic: no mark, no annotate switch.

                     The contract is "exactly one, and it is the content the reader
                     is looking at". So it rides `shown` and not `activeMode`: the
                     swap above keeps BOTH frames mounted while the incoming
                     document loads, and only the shown one is on screen (the other
                     is transparent and un-clickable), so marking the active mode
                     mid-swap would aim the pins at a frame nobody can see. `shown`
                     catches up the moment that frame paints.

                     `splitCapable` is what keeps it to the single-file explorer
                     preview: a folder renders <Listing> and never reaches this
                     branch, and a panel/tab embed has no sidebar to answer the
                     mark. When no content pane shows at all — a listing, a pending
                     gate, the fallback card — no frame renders and the mark is
                     simply absent, which is exactly how the template is told
                     there is nothing to annotate. */

                     same condition today and they do not mean the same thing —
                     one says "this frame is what notes point at", the other says
                     "a revision can be driven into this frame". A sidebar reading
                     the annotate mark to decide whether to offer a commit preview
                     would be inferring one capability from another, and the day
                     either condition moves it would silently be wrong.

                     Same contract shape as the annotate mark, for the same reason
                     and read the same way (the git template polls
                     `parent.document` for it): PRESENT ONLY WHERE THE CAPABILITY
                     REALLY EXISTS. `splitCapable` is what makes this the single-
                     file explorer preview — the one surface with both a content
                     pane and a git sidebar to select in — and `m === shown` keeps
                     it on the frame the reader is actually looking at, since the
                     held-frame swap can leave two mounted. A folder's listing
                     preview pane renders no frame at all and so stamps nothing,
                     which is exactly how the git template running in THAT pane
                     learns it has nothing to drive. */

        {/* EMBED ONLY, by the CSS (see .preview-browse-chip): it is the embed's
            whole mode affordance, because the embed hides .preview-header and
            with it the switcher (PT-13/D65).

            It briefly had a second, explorer-side reveal — `is-exit`, for a
            folder showing a non-listing mode — on the grounds that PT-13b's
            missing top-bar switcher left that state with no way back to the
            listing. Removed by owner call: floating over the template's own
            content it read as a stray tooltip rather than as chrome (a
            full-width timeline view once wore it on its own header), and
            the way back out of a mode you navigated into is the browser's Back
            button, which costs the view nothing to provide.

            Not while the listing's preview pane is open: the chip pins to this
            element's top-right corner, and with the pane on, that corner is
            INSIDE the pane — the chip lands in the pane's header row, where it
            reads as pane chrome. It is not (it switches the FOLDER's mode, not
            the previewed file's), so a bare mode name like "Claude" sitting
            there is a mystery button.

            **That guard now bites in `_listing` mode ALWAYS**, because since D282
            a listing always has a pane — `listingPaneOpen` is exactly `isListing`.
            So the chip only ever renders over a NON-listing mode, and its label is
            unconditionally "Browse contents"; the `isListing` label branches
            ("Back", the counterpart's own name) were unreachable and are deleted
            rather than left as a suggestion that they can happen.

            **The direction that is now unreachable is listing → the other mode.**
            In an embed the whole `.preview-header` and its switcher are hidden, so
            this chip was the only control there: a `.zarr` folder embedded at any
            width can go map → listing and then has nothing to click back with. It
            is a dead end, not a degradation, and it is left standing on purpose —
            the fix is either a chip that does not sit under the pane's corner or a
            pane the embed does not get, and re-gating either on a WIDTH is what
            D282 removed. Recorded in D282 for the owner to rule on.

            **Under a FOREIGN host the chip navigates the TOP WINDOW instead**
            (D331). An embed framed by a non-explorer page (the canvases
            workspace's chat pane) is a component in someone else's layout: an
            in-place `_mode` swap there turns the host's chat column into a
            chrome-free listing — half a browsing surface where the host put a
            conversation — and walks straight into the dead end above. "Browse
            contents" under that host means "take me to the real explorer for
            this folder", so the whole page goes to the view-prefixed URL (a
            plain location.assign: the host is a different document, and Back
            returns to it). Inside the explorer's own surfaces (panel panes,
            tabs — IS_FOREIGN_EMBED is false there) the in-place switch stays:
            those panes own their layout and a top nav would blow it away. */}
