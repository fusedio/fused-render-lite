// Crumb bar, in three zones left to right:
//
//   path    ‹ › history arrows, then the crumbs (or the editable path field),
//           then the ★ bookmark button
//   mode    the `#topbar-mode-slot` portal target — Preview renders the view's
//           conditional primary action, the shared mode control and the preview
//           sidebar's toggle into it
//   search  wherever the merged field has claimed the bar — a folder's
//           listing or a plain file's own field — it portals in here, so its
//           column has one header strip instead of two (search-slot.ts)
//
// THE PATH ZONE'S TWO ENDS CHANGED PLACES, and the arrows are why. The ★ opened
// the bar for a long time, which put the one control that acts on the WHOLE view
// in the slot every browser, file manager and IDE reserves for going back — so
// the muscle-memory click at the bar's left edge hit a bookmark toggle. Back and
// forward now hold that slot, and the star moved to where its own subject ends:
// immediately after the last crumb, reading as "this path, starred", which is
// also how a browser's location bar arranges it. Nothing about the star's
// behaviour moved with it (BookmarkStar below is unchanged); only its seat.
//
// The Finder and split glyphs used to live INSIDE the crumb strip, welded to
// the last path segment: the path zone was not only the path, and "open in
// Finder" (rare) sat at the same weight as the splits (frequent). They then
// separated — reveal/copy into a `···` overflow, the splits into a layout zone
// of their own at the bar's far right — converged again as NAMED ITEMS in one
// path `⋮` (see LayoutZone's epitaph below), and have now left the bar's markup
// altogether: they are items in its RIGHT-CLICK menu, which is the view's own
// (onBarContextMenu / topbar-menu.ts).
//
// Rendered by every view: path crumbs for listing/preview, a static label for
// the layout modes (LM-11 / TM-9 — ★/update still operate on currentUrl()).

// How long a file drag has to hover a crumb before the listing follows it.
// Spring-loading is the standard file-manager answer to "the folder I want to
// drop into isn't on screen": hold over an ancestor and it opens, with the drag
// still in your hand.
//
// 700ms is the dwell that separates "hovering here" from "passing over on the
// way somewhere else" — a crumb strip is a dense row of small targets, and a
// shorter dwell navigates out from under a drag that was only crossing it.
const SPRING_LOAD_MS = 700;

// A crumb is BOTH a spring-loaded navigation and a real drop target: hold and
// the ancestor opens with the drag still in your hand, release and the entries
// move into it.
//
// It used to be spring-load only — no `data-fs-drop-path` — on the argument that
// dropping ON a path segment gives no listing to see the result in and no way to
// choose between adjacent ancestors. The second half of that is answered by the
// per-crumb highlight every other drop target already gets (row-drag paints
// `drop-into` / `drop-reject` on whatever the pointer is over, from the same
// dropIsValid verdict), and the first by `data-fs-drop-announce`: the
// destination is off screen, so the move toasts, exactly as a drop onto a
// sidebar bookmark does.
//
// What the old arrangement actually produced was WORSE than either reading: with
// no drop host under the pointer, row-drag put `fs-drag-refused` on the body, so
// the strip wore the NO-DROP cursor for the whole hover — while hovering there
// was doing something useful — and a release did nothing at all. One hover, two
// meanings, painted as a rejection. The refusals are truthful now instead of
// universal: dropping on the crumb of the folder you are already in is
// "already-there" (drag-drop's dropIsValid, which has the crumb cases tested).
//
// `data-fs-drop-dir` is "1" with no stat probe — a path segment the listing is
// inside is a directory by construction.
//
// THE HARD PART IS NOT THE ATTRIBUTES, IT IS THAT THE SPRING-LOAD DESTROYS WHAT
// THE DROP DEPENDS ON. Navigating mid-drag replaces the hovered crumb (it becomes
// the current-folder crumb), re-lays out the strip under a pointer that has not
// moved, re-renders away the imperatively painted drop ring, and unmounts the
// listing whose registered mover the drop was going to use. A drag only
// re-resolves its target on pointer MOVEMENT, so none of that was noticed. Three
// things answer it together, and they only work as a set:
//
//   • every crumb is a drop target, the current-folder one included — that is the
//     crumb the pointer lands on after a spring-load (see dropProps);
//   • the strip tells the drag when it has changed, via row-drag's
//     refreshDropTarget, from an effect on fsPath and armedTarget — so the spot,
//     the cursor and the ring are rebuilt against the live DOM, and what is
//     painted is what a release will use, because both come from that one hit
//     test;
//   • row-drag resolves the performer as target listing → origin listing → the
//     listing that is actually on screen (its liveMover), because after a
//     spring-load the first two are gone.
//
// Enter and leave used to be the DOM's own `dragenter`/`dragleave`. The row
// drag is pointer-driven now (listing/row-drag.ts), so they arrive as calls
// instead — in the same order, deliberately, because the disarm rule below is
// written against that order.
