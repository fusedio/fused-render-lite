// WHO ANSWERS A RIGHT-CLICK ON THE CRUMB BAR — the view underneath it.
//
// The bar itself (Breadcrumb.tsx) knows a path and nothing else. The menu a
// right-click on it should open is the CONTENT's: over a folder that is the
// listing's own header menu, built from a clipboard, a refetch and a dialog
// stack the bar cannot see (listing/useFileOps); over a file it is the preview's
// file menu, whose Rename drives a prompt dialog the preview owns (Preview's
// usePreviewFileMenu). Both already keep menu state, render a <ContextMenu>, and
// hold the overlay count that makes the listing's keyboard shortcuts stand down
// while a menu is open — so the bar does not build a menu at all. It asks the
// owner to open one at the cursor.
//
// A module store rather than props for the reason folder-chrome.ts is one: the
// bar and the content are SIBLINGS under App, and which of them the content
// resolves to is decided several levels below the bar, after it has rendered.
//
// No subscribe/snapshot pair here, unlike the slot stores: nothing RENDERS from
// this. The opener is read at event time, inside the contextmenu handler, so a
// publish must not (and does not) re-render the bar.
//
// A STACK with newest-wins, for the same reason folder-chrome keeps one: a
// folder→file (or folder→folder) swap holds both views mounted for a commit,
// and a straight assign-on-publish/clear-on-release would leave the bar either
// pointing at the outgoing view or at nothing, depending on effect order. Each
// publisher gets its own release, idempotent, called by the effect that made it.
//
// Only the view that OWNS the bar publishes — the folder listing that claimed
// the chrome, or the preview whose actions are in the topbar. A preview pane
// inside a folder view, or a listing embedded in one, has its own chrome and
// must not answer for the window's bar.
// `crumb` is set when the right-click landed on an ANCESTOR crumb rather than on
// the bar at large: the path of that folder, which is NOT the folder the view is
// showing. The owner then opens the small ancestor menu (lib/bar-menus'
// crumbMenu) instead of its own list — its own list acts on the CURRENT
// directory, so on an ancestor crumb it answered about the wrong folder. The bar
// decides which crumb (it owns the strip); the owner still renders the menu.
