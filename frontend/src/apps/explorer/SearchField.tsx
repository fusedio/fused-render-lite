// THE MERGED SEARCH FIELD — one box, rendered by whichever view currently
// claims the crumb bar's search row (folder-chrome.ts): a folder's own
// Listing, or a file's own Preview. Both hosts render this exact component
// with this exact JSX; the difference between them is entirely in what they
// pass it, never in a second copy of the markup.
//
// A folder host owns real search state — the query answers real rows it is
// about to show in its own body — so it keeps calling useListingSearch,
// useCompletion and useTypedPathAddress itself and hands the results down.
// A file host has no body of its own to answer: committing a query there
// navigates to the parent folder instead of showing anything in place (see
// FileSearchField.tsx), so its caller supplies the same shape of props built
// from the SAME hooks, called against the parent path, with the results-
// display props (spinner/count/pin) left inert since nothing here ever shows
// them before the navigation away.
//
// What stays LOCAL to this component, in both hosts, is the field's own
// interaction chrome: whether it is pinned open, which completion row is
// highlighted, whether the field is focused right now, and the measured
// width that picks the short or long placeholder. None of that answers
// anything about search RESULTS, so neither host needs it and duplicating it
// per host would be the drift this component exists to prevent.

            revised (user preference, on seeing both on a running screen):
            the words stay — "Search ⌘L" — the defect was never the WORDS,
            it was that they wore no chassis and caught no click. It is a
            real button now, on the same `bar-ctl` family the neighbouring
            `⋮` and `★` controls ride, with the words as its actual content
            rather than a bespoke outlined pill (that would just reproduce
            the original complaint: four things on one line, four
            disagreeing styles). This also removes the "two magnifiers"
            risk the spec flagged as its riskiest unverifiable detail —
            with the left chip icon-only (scope item 1) and this button
            carrying the word, only one magnifier glyph exists at all once
            `!boxWide` collapses this button to it.

            `boxWide` is the SAME measurement (`HINT_WIDE_PX`, `searchBoxRef`
            above) the placeholder's own long/short switch already uses —
            not a second breakpoint — collapsing this button to the bare
            glyph exactly where the field is too narrow for the words to
            fit without wrapping or clipping.

            `requestSearchFocus` is the exact call Breadcrumb.tsx's own
            ⌘L/Ctrl+L listener makes (listing/search-focus.ts) — reused
            rather than a second path to the same open-and-focus behaviour.
            The SEED differs, and that is the whole difference between the
            two gestures: ⌘L is the location bar and opens holding the
            current address, this button says "Search" and opens empty,
            because a search box that opens holding the folder you are
            already looking at has to be cleared before it can be used.

            `data-hint` carries the box's own grammar (SEARCH_GRAMMAR_HINT,
            above) rather than a native `title` — `hints.ts` is this app's
            one instant, un-clippable tooltip, and a native title would
            double up with it (both firing over the same point). The
            accessible name stays on `aria-label` below; the hint is a
            sighted-hover affordance only, read by nothing else. */}
