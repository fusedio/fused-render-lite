// Whether this machine is signed in to Fused, for readers OUTSIDE the Canvases
// page — today the shell sidebar, which shows its Canvases row only once there
// is an account behind it.
//
// A SEPARATE MODULE FROM index.ts, for the reason available.ts spells out for
// Claude Config: the barrel re-exports Canvases/CanvasWorkspace, so a sidebar
// that probed through it would pull the whole canvases app — workspace, lock
// lib, embed host — into the shell's main bundle for one boolean. Import this
// file directly and the app itself stays lazy behind its route.
//
// ONE POLL, TWO READERS (shell/tasksPulse's shape, same reason): the sidebar
// subscribes, and the Canvases page PUBLISHES what its own status poll returned
// — including the fast in-flight poll it runs during the browser login — so the
// row appears the moment the login lands instead of waiting out the interval
// below. Unlike claude_config's availability this flips mid-session: signing in
// and out is a thing people do, so one cached answer would be wrong for the
// rest of the session.
