// Whether Canvases is OFFERED on this machine — the `canvases_enabled`
// preference (D427, shell/prefs.py), read by the shell rather than by the
// canvases app: the sidebar shows its row and the Settings menu its entry only
// once someone has turned the feature on. Default off.
//
// A SEPARATE MODULE FROM index.ts, for the reason logged-in.ts spells out: the
// barrel re-exports Canvases/CanvasWorkspace, so a sidebar that read the flag
// through it would pull the whole canvases app — workspace, lock lib, embed
// host — into the shell's main bundle for one boolean. Import this file
// directly and the app itself stays lazy behind its route.
//
// A SEPARATE FACT FROM logged-in.ts, too, and deliberately not folded into it:
// "is this feature offered" and "is there an account behind it" answer
// different questions, and only the primary nav row wants both (the Settings
// menu entry is gated on this one alone — it has always been the affordance for
// "there is a thing here you could set up"). The call site ANDs them.
//
// ONE FETCH, NOT A POLL — the difference from logged-in.ts. A login happens
// elsewhere (another window, `fused login` in a terminal) and so has to be
// watched for; this pref can only change on the Preferences page of this app,
// and that page PUBLISHES its new value, so the row appears or disappears the
// moment the checkbox settles. A hand-edited prefs.json is picked up on the
// next load, which is the same deal every other pref on that page offers.
