// THE STANDING LIVE WATCH (D415, inventory 05 §D, T:17550-17745). Pure TS: the
// triggers are wired to `window`/`document` by `start()`, everything else is
// injected, so the whole policy is testable with fake timers.
//
// PR1 shipped the WINDOW around opening a chat — `adoptLiveRun`'s ~3 s of laps,
// which is the whole of the page's answer to "was something already running
// when I got here?". It covers arriving late and covers nothing after: a
// session that becomes busy while this chat sits open lit no indicator and
// streamed nothing, whoever started the turn. The reported case is the
// harness's own — a background shell finishes, the run wakes for another turn —
// and it is not the only one: the same chat open in a second pane, a `claude`
// the user resumed from a terminal, a spawn from the canvases workspace. None
// of them go through `sendMessage`, which is the only path that arms the
// running chrome.
//
// So the question is asked on a timer for the life of the page, and asked of
// the SERVER — the one party that knows a run is alive — rather than inferred
// from what this frame happens to have sent.
//
// A TIMER ALONE IS A BLIND WINDOW AND A SHORT TURN FITS INSIDE IT (Akshil,
// 2026-08-21, two tabs on one chat): a 10 s interval found runs that had
// already FINISHED, so `resumeRun` took its done-branch and repaired the
// transcript in silence. The fix is to ask SOONER, not to arm harder — three
// triggers, cheapest and fastest first:
//
//   * A POKE FROM THE TAB THAT STARTED IT. `stampChatActivity` already writes
//     `localStorage` at the START of every turn this app runs, for the shell's
//     tasks store — and a `storage` event fires in every OTHER document on this
//     origin and never in the writer, which is exactly the shape needed. The
//     two-tab case costs no polling at all and lands in milliseconds.
//   * BECOMING VISIBLE / FOCUSED. A tab that was in the background while
//     something ran should not wait out an interval to catch up.
//   * THE INTERVAL, 5 s and SKIPPED while the document is hidden. It is the
//     backstop for the one starter that pokes nothing this page can hear — a
//     run spawned by the server (a scheduled message, the canvases workspace).
//
// Hidden tabs give up the interval deliberately: chrome nobody is looking at is
// worth nothing, the storage poke still reaches them, and becoming visible laps
// at once.
