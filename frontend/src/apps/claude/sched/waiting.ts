// THE MESSAGES THIS CHAT IS STILL WAITING TO SEND — drawn from the SERVER, in
// the transcript, in the order they were typed (the project queue, prefs
// `queue.enabled`).
//
// WHAT THIS REPLACES, and why it is a different shape. Until 2026-09-12 a queued
// send was a CHIP: a card the chat minted at admission time, holding its own copy
// of the words, living in client state for as long as the entry stayed pending.
// Two things were wrong with it and both were structural rather than cosmetic:
//
//   1. A RELOAD SHOWED A DIFFERENT CONVERSATION. The chips were client state, so
//      a refresh — or a nav away and back, or the very session adoption this
//      feature causes — dropped every one of them while the entries were still
//      sitting in the line. The reader's messages were safe on the server and
//      invisible on screen, which is the worst of the two possible failures.
//   2. IT WAS A SECOND KIND OF THING IN A TRANSCRIPT. A conversation is a column
//      of bubbles; a card with a ring and two buttons parked under the last one
//      read as chrome about the chat rather than as part of it.
//
// So the rule is now: EVERYTHING IS WRITTEN TO THE SERVER IN THE ORDER TYPED, AND
// THE CHAT DRAWS WHAT THE SERVER HOLDS. A waiting message is a user bubble with a
// dashed border at its place in the transcript, and one muted line under it. The
// optimistic copy drawn the instant a send is admitted is THE SAME ROW, minted
// early from the admission's answer and replaced by the server's own on the next
// poll — same id, so it is never two rows.
//
// ONE ADDRESS, ONE PICTURE. Which messages are this conversation's is asked of
// the WHOLE listing, by session and by `follow_of` together (`waitingFor` →
// `useSchedule.waitingHere`) — because a chat can be both at once: a new chat
// whose first message queued has no session to filter by, and the instant its
// leader runs it has one while its followers still name nothing. Two lists
// swapped on that fact dropped every row in the swap; one rule does not.

 * followers, with a session it read the session-filtered pending list
 * (`schedPendingHere`). Adoption flips exactly that fact — the
 * leader runs, the chat opens the session its run created — and in that instant
 * BOTH lists miss the followers: the session filter because the server fills a
 * follower's `session_id` only when it CLAIMS it, and the leader list because
 * the leader id is a client memory that a reload (or the adoption's own clearing
 * rule) drops. So the reader's queued messages disappeared from the transcript
 * while sitting perfectly safely in the line — the exact failure the move to
 * server-drawn rows was made to end.
 *
 * SO THE QUESTION IS ASKED OF THE GROUP, NOT OF ONE FIELD. An entry belongs to
 * this conversation when it NAMES the session, or when it is connected — through
 * `follow_of`, in either direction and as many hops as it takes — to an entry
 * that does. The leader is the hinge: once it has run it is the only row in the
 * schedule carrying both the session id and the id its followers name, and that
 * is why this is asked of the WHOLE listing rather than the pending slice.
 * `leaderId` is still taken, for the chat whose leader has not run yet and which
 * therefore has no session for anything to name.
 *
 * ONLY WAITING ROWS COME BACK (`schedIsWaiting` — pending, or claimed), deduped
 * by id and in due order, which for a chat's own sends is the order they were
 * typed.

 *
 * THE HEADER AND THE CARD OVER THE COMPOSER NOW SAY ONE THING (Akshil, browser
 * QA 2026-09-18). The header read `useSchedule.row` and nothing else — the
 * LISTING FEED's row, which is the fast answer when it arrives and no answer
 * when it does not: the feed's long-poll parks while the document is hidden and
 * its floor refresh is skipped for the same reason (`shell/tasksPulse`), so a
 * pane left open in a background tab kept its done ring while the very same
 * pane's waiting bubble and its "1 message waiting · behind TASK-046" card,
 * both drawn off `waitingFacts` above, were already right. One send, two
 * answers, three pixels apart, until the reader reloaded.
 *
 * So the header asks what the card asks, in the card's own order:
 *
 *   * IS ANYTHING OF THIS CHAT'S WAITING AT ALL — `waitCount`, the card's own
 *     gate, so the two surfaces appear and leave together by construction. It is
 *     the freshest thing the pane has: the schedule poll's entries and the
 *     seeds the send itself laid down, neither of which stops while the feed
 *     does. It gates the row as well, and that half is a bug of its own —
 *     a frozen feed row that said `queued` once said it for ever, so a header
 *     that finally learned it was in a line then could not learn it had left
 *     one. A busy conversation is never in a line either: a scheduled message
 *     held behind this chat's OWN turn is the one case where both are true, and
 *     there the ring belongs to the run.
 *   * THEN THE FEED'S ROW, WHEN IT SAYS `queued`. It is the only one of the
 *     three that carries this conversation's own number and title, which the
 *     identity block draws, and it is the server's word.
 *   * ELSE THE CARD'S FACTS (`waitingFacts`: the polled row, else the admission
 *     that queued the message, plus a Run next claim) — which is the whole of
 *     what the pane knows when the feed has said nothing.

/**
 * THE NUMBER AT THE TOP OF A CHAT — "TASK-057" — from the freshest of the three
 * places that can know it.
 *
 * A QUEUED NEW CHAT HAS ONE FROM THE FIRST SECOND, and used to show none for up
 * to a poll interval (Akshil, 2026-09-12). The entry IS the task: the admission
 * that queued the message creates it and names it back in the same answer. But
 * the header read `/api/tasks` and nothing else, so a reader watched their own
 * conversation sit numberless while the id they would need to find it again on
 * the Tasks page was already in hand.
 *
 * THE ORDER IS BY FRESHNESS, not by preference:
 *
 *   1. `fromTasks` — `ui/Kebab.useTaskId`, a listing read keyed on this
 *      conversation (its session, or `pending:<leader>` before it has one). The
 *      most recent answer there is, and the one that survives a rekey. TAKEN
 *      ONLY WHEN IT IS SHAPED LIKE A TASK ID: that read FAILS OPEN to a
 *      truncated session hash, which is a fine label for the topbar to fall back
 *      to on its own (`ui/Topbar`) and a terrible one to rank ABOVE the row and
 *      the admission here, both of which hold the real number.
 *   2. `fromRow` — the schedule hook's own row for this chat (`useSchedule.rec`),
 *      which the pane is already paying for and which lands on its own cadence.
 *   3. `fromAdmit` — what the admission said. Minted before either listing
 *      existed and never stale in the way the others can be: a task id is
 *      allocated once and never reused, so this can only be right or absent.
 *
 * "" when none of them has answered, which is the landing and every chat that is
 * not a task.
