// THE ROOT of the native chat: the token-scoped `.chat-root` box, the layout
// variants, the boot branch, and the wiring between `protocol/run-controller`
// and everything in `ui/` and `pane/`.
//
// Sources: T's boot IIFE (T:19178-19296) for the branch and its 1.5 s ask race,
// T:16336 for the end-of-run `typer.finish` → `attachCodeCopy` ordering,
// T:15947-15978 for Escape, T:14652-14663 for the narrow hard block, and
// inventories 00 §1e / 01 §A+§G / 04 §F / 05 §G. Nothing here talks to the
// shell: hosts hand facts down as props and get hops back through `onNavigate`.
//
// WHAT THE IFRAME USED TO BUY, and where each of those now lives (00 §1e):
//   * param isolation   → `params/store.ts` (a memory store per mount)
//   * its own scroller  → `.chat-root` is a full-height flex column and
//                         `Transcript`'s `.chat-logwrap` is the one scroller
//                         (the host cards are `overflow: hidden`)
//   * focus             → `autoFocus`, threaded to the composer's textarea
//   * CSS cuts          → `styles/chat.css`'s `.chat-compact` / `.chat-only` /
//                         `.chat-peek` blocks
//   * the ready signal  → `onReady`, which replaces `dataset.chatReady`
//   * the activity poke → `onActivity`: the controller announces on THIS
//                         document, `stampChatActivity` tells every other one
//                         (T:16435)

                more.

                AND THE ACTION THE COPY NAMES IS A BUTTON (R1-4). The sentence
                asks the reader to reload the page; without `onRetry` the card
                drew no button at all, so it named an action it did not offer
                (`main.tsx`'s boot card, the other one, has always passed one).
                Only when there IS a target: "there's nothing to open a chat
                on" is answered by opening a file, and a Reload button under

  // ONE render of the host and `undefined` on the very next one, whatever
  // caused it. With `props.initialAsk` in the boot effect's deps, that flip
  // tore the boot down 32 ms into the ≤1.5 s model/effort detection wait — the
  // cleanup set `cancelled` and re-armed the latch, so the awaited send was
  // skipped, and the re-run read `undefined` and took the "nothing to restore"
  // branch. `entered` stayed true from the first pass, so the user got exactly
  // what QA reported: the chat opens, the composer is live, and the prompt is
  // gone (R4-4). Legacy is immune because its template PULLS the ask at its own
  // boot, where no React prop can vanish underneath it.
  //
  // Sticky and never un-set, so a host re-render inside the wait cannot cancel
  // a send already on its way. Still exactly one send: `bootDispatched` (per
  // boot) and `bootedFor` (per controller) are what enforce that, not the

   * content is unsent words, that composer is where unsent words live, and the
   * reader is looking straight at it — so nothing navigates, nothing enters,
   * and no URL moves. The text lands in the box with the caret after it.
   *
   * THROUGH THE SAME SEAT STRANDED WORDS COME BACK ON (`restore`), with
   * `replace: true` (bug report, 2026-09-15): a row's whole content REPLACES
   * whatever the box held, it does not join onto it — "make sure text before
   * it in composer is cleaned and only draft text is there". Its own counter,
   * because the landing's composer and the chat's are two instances with two
   * delivery ledgers and a hand-back is not a draft press.
   *
   * THIS COMPOSER'S OWN ROW IS A FOCUS REQUEST AND NOTHING ELSE, checked
   * BEFORE anything is read (bug report, 2026-09-15). It is drawn as a row
   * only because it names the key this very box already autosaves under, so
   * pressing it is not a fill at all — replacing from a stale GET would throw
   * away anything typed since the box's own last write, which a request for
   * the keyboard must never do.
   *
   * A SECOND PRESS ON A ROW ALREADY MOVING IS IGNORED, not a second draft
   * (bug report, 2026-09-15: pressing the same row two or three times used to
   * mint a fresh `new:<file>` draft under the same words each time, because
   * nothing here waited for the first move to land or for the list to catch
   * up and drop the row). `movingKeys` guards the SOURCE key — this composer
   * has exactly one destination, so the source is the only side two presses
   * in flight together could disagree about.

   * THE LEADER RAN, SO THIS CHAT HAS A SESSION NOW — adopt it.
   *
   * The gap this closes: a new chat whose first message was queued has no
   * session, so every later send joins that entry as a follower
   * (`sched/queue-leader`). The SCHEDULER runs the leader, not this page — and
   * none of the chat's roads to a session id begin anywhere but here. The
   * schedule watcher's attach is the nearest thing and it is not enough: it
   * needs a live `run_id` to probe, so a leader that ran and finished while this
   * tab was in the background leaves nothing to attach to, and a FOLLOWER's run
   * is written off outright (`scheduledRunIsOurs` adopts only entries naming no
   * session on a session-less screen). Without this the chat stays a chat with
   * no session for ever: new followers behind a leader that is long gone, and a
   * transcript showing none of what it said.
   *
   * THE ENTRY IS THE RECORD — `claude_session_id`, read off the poll this pane
   * already pays for (`sched.ranSessions`) — and the adoption is `openSession`,
   * which is what every other "open that conversation" gesture in this file
   * spends (`onOpenSession`, the sessions list, Peek). It brings the real
   * transcript with it, which is the point: the optimistic bubbles are replaced
   * by what the run actually said.
   *
   * THE ROWS STAY, AND THEY STAY BY THEMSELVES. They are the server's
   * (`sched/waiting.waitingFor`, through `sched.waitingHere`): those follower
   * entries are still waiting in this folder's line, and the group they belong to
   * is read off `follow_of` and the leader's own session — so the very poll that
   * hands this chat its session id goes on listing them. Nothing here has to
   * carry them across, and nothing here may drop them: the adoption replaces the
   * TRANSCRIPT, not the line.
   *
   * NO GUARD REF. `openSession` emits the id, `state.sessionId` stops being ""
   * and `leaderSession` answers "" from then on — the effect's own dependency is
   * what closes it. `setEntered` is for the landing case: this chat may never

                — a caption saying so would be this feature narrating the app's
                normal behaviour back at the reader (design.md, UI).

                THEY ARE DRAWN FROM THE RUN (`state.inbox`), which is what makes

                is this document's memory and does not survive one, and the

                chat's own sends is the order they were typed, and nothing of
                this conversation's can be after them — so drawing them
                immediately under the log IS drawing them in the transcript,
                without threading a per-turn slot through it for rows that belong
                to the schedule rather than to the run.

                DRAWN FROM THE SERVER (`waiting`), which is what makes a reload
                paint the identical picture. The row the admission puts up a
                second after Enter is the same row, minted early from the
                answer and replaced by the server's own on the next poll.
