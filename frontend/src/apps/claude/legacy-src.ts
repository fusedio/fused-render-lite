//
// Each of these was an inline template string (or a shell helper) at its own
// call site; every one is copied VERBATIM, argument order and all, because the
// parity guard is byte-for-byte and a reordered `&_remote=1` is a different
// string even though it is the same request (00 §1a/§1b).
//
// The wrappers stay at the call sites, deliberately: `withNoFocus`
// (platform/lib/frame-focus) and `revSrc` (apps/explorer/lib/preview-rev) are
// facts about the HOST — a thumbnail shell, a git revision being previewed — and
// folding them in here would make six builders into twelve.
//
// Pure string functions, no DOM, no React: `legacy-src.test.ts` pins each one
// against the literal shape its old site produced.
