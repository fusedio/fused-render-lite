 * `beginSend` folds every pending sendable note into the message, so an Enter
 * pressed mid-walkthrough uploaded still-wordless marks and the transcript then
 * wrote words onto notes already stamped `sent` — words the agent never saw,
 * silently mutating a note it had already been handed. The nav lock does not
 * cover this: it greys the ways OUT of the chat, and the composer stays live on
 * purpose (a line typed during a walkthrough is a normal thing to send).
 *
 * So while the walkthrough owns the mode (`walkthroughOwns`: the mic's start
 * window, the recording itself, Stopping… and Transcribing…) a note with no
 * words is not sendable YET. A note that has words is sendable throughout —
 * including on the walkthrough's own auto-send, which fires from inside
 * Transcribing… the moment `assignWords` has written them. And once the mode is
