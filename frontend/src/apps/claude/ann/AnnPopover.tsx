//
// ONE NODE that MOVES. An iframe cannot paint outside its own box and the target
// may be a sibling frame elsewhere in the host's layout, so a popover that has
// to appear beside the element it describes has to BE a node in that element's
// document (T:7241). `adoptNode` moves it there; a close brings it home.
//
// The node, not a copy — and imperative, not React. Everything the composer is
// lives on it (the keydown that saves on Enter and closes on Escape, the delete
// button's click, the textarea's current text), and while it is portaled it is
// outside React's root container, where React's delegated events never fire: a
// React-rendered card would go dead the moment it was lent out, and a rebuilt
// one would be a second implementation to keep in step.
