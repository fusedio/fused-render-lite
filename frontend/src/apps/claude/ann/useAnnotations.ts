  // Stopping…/Transcribing… the seat came back to life wearing the `.on` ✓ Done
  // face, and a click there ran `done()` — auto-submitting the walkthrough's
  // wordless stamped marks and disarming mid-transcription, so the transcript
  // landed on notes already sent empty. `walkthroughOwns(mode)` alone is too
  // tight: it also covers the settle the reader has ALREADY LEFT with Esc,
  // where T:7656-7660 is explicit that the seat comes back — "Esc during a
  // transcription disarms HERE, and a seat left disabled until annRecEnd's
  // finally would block exactly the re-arm the epoch guard is written to
  // protect."
  //
  // Both facts hold at once when the test is "the settle still OWNS the mode",
  // which is the walkthrough's phase AND `annOn`. Armed + settling → inert, and
  // the ✓ Done click that broke things is unreachable. Disarmed + settling →
  // live, and the click ARMS A NEW ROUND rather than finishing the old one,
  // which is precisely what the epoch guard in `end()` exists to keep safe.
