// THE RECORD AFFORDANCE — `#annrec` + `#annreclbl` (T:3993-3995) and the bar's
// ■/clock/trash (T:6221-6240), as one component.
//
// It is ONE control with four faces, not four controls, because that is what
// the walkthrough actually is: the mic starts it, the same seat stops it (the
// pulsing seat IS the live control, T:8329-8331), and through the settle it
// becomes a STATUS rather than a button — a disabled seat named for what is
// happening. T learned that the hard way (Bugbot, PR #665): with the recording
// flag gone but the armed CSS still on, the seat showed an enabled ✓ Done for
// the width of the stop, and a click there disarmed the mode before
// transcription ever started (T:8167-8177).
//
// Every string here is T's, verbatim, with its line. The GLYPHS are T's too
// (T:3995 mic, T:6244 trash) so the seat is the right width the moment it comes
// alive — and the seat's glyph is the MIC in all four faces (P3R1-4): T:3995
// bakes one `<svg class="rec-mic">` into `#annrec` and no rule anywhere swaps
// it, so the recording is drawn as an ACTIVE seat, never as a different one.
//
// Presentational only: no store, no capture, no timers. `ann/rec.ts` owns the
// state and the clock; the AnnBar passes a snapshot and three callbacks.
