// THE PENDING NOTES' CHIPS (T:6963-7030), which ride the attachment tray as its
// children (`ui/AttachTray`'s `children` slot).
//
// The SAME pill a screenshot's chip is, because both are things this message is
// about to carry and both come off with the same ✕ — one row reading "what is
// attached" rather than two features that happen to be neighbours (T:927).
//
// AND THE SAME PILL MEANS THE SAME MARKUP (P3R1-2). It shared the outer
// `.c-annchip` and nothing else: a bare `<button>` for the ✕, which took the UA
// button chrome and drew a bordered box beside a borderless one, and a
// `.c-annchip-txt` of its own that sat outside `.c-chip-door` — so the badge and
// the words were two flex items rather than one, with no shared inset, and the
// pill's hover lit nothing (owner, 2026-09-10: "misaligned, bordered ✕"). The
// chip now renders the attachment chip's exact three-part shape — `.c-chip-door`
// carrying the glyph slot (`.c-pinlbl`) and the words (`.c-txt`), with
// `.c-chip-x` as its only sibling — so one stylesheet block dresses both kinds
// and the two cannot drift again. The glyph slot is where the attachment chip
// puts its lucide icon; here it holds the pin's own letter, and the crosshair
// before it for a point note.
//
// T has TWO chip rows, one above each composer, "because one node can't be in
// both" (T:7036). React has no such problem: this is one component rendered
// wherever the tray is, and the home and chat composers each get their own
// instance of the tray.
