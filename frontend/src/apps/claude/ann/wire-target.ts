// seven listeners over there, attached on every document LOAD (the app live-reloads
// on Claude's edits) and gating on the mode, so toggling never needs a rewire.
//
// ONE WIRING PER DOCUMENT, marked on the document itself: a reload brings a fresh
// document and must be wired again, while re-adopting a frame we already wired —
// the mark leaving and coming back as the reader switches the pane's mode to and
// fro — must not stack a second set of listeners on it (T:8524).
