// Nothing here touches the document, on purpose: the 205 lines of `annRecEnd`
// are half status-seat repainting and half a state machine whose bugs (Bugbot

// settle, a stale ender repainting a live seat) are invisible in a screenshot.
// So the machine lives here with its deps injected, `ann/RecControls.tsx` draws
