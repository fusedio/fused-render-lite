// Whether chat embeds render the native React chat (`apps/claude`) instead of
// the legacy `templates/claude` iframe — the `native_chat_enabled` pref
// (shell/prefs.py), env override `FUSED_RENDER_NATIVE_CHAT` applied server-side.
// DEFAULT ON since 2026-09-17: the pref reads `!== false` on both sides, so the
// switch is an escape hatch back to the iframe rather than an opt-in beta.
// Clone of apps/canvases/feature-flag.ts: one shared GET, a generation guard so
// a publish beats a slower in-flight read, and `null` meaning "not asked yet".
//
// THE TRI-STATE IS THE POINT FOR A MOUNT (`useNativeChatFlag`). Canvases only
// hides a menu entry while the answer is in flight, so `null` there reads as OFF
// and costs nothing; here a premature `false` mounts a whole `/render` template
// DOCUMENT, which boots, restores a session, drains
// `window._fusedClaudeAskTake` and starts a poll — and is then thrown away the
// instant the GET lands, taking the pending "Fix with AI" ask with it. So a
// MOUNT waits for a real answer (ChatMount covers the box meanwhile) and only a
// host asking a side question — "is a legacy iframe the thing owning params
// here?" — takes the boolean, where "not asked yet" genuinely does read as off.
//
// WHICH MAKES A FAILED READ AN ANSWER, NOT AN ABSENCE: `null` is only ever
// "in flight", so `read()` retries once and then settles on `false` (see the
// `catch`). A tri-state that could stick at `null` would hold a skeleton over
// every embed on the page forever.
//
// A SEPARATE MODULE FROM index.ts on purpose: the barrel re-exports ClaudeChat,
// and a host reading the flag through it would pull the whole chat (and the
// markdown chunk) into its bundle for one boolean.
