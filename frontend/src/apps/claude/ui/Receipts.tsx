// THE RECEIPT a sent turn wears (T:10815 `shotReceipt`, T:11079 `annReceiptRow`,

//
// ONE builder for the live send and for a restored transcript, which is the
// whole point: a screenshot that is visible while the session lasts and gone the
// moment it is reopened is a screenshot the user cannot rely on having sent
// (T:10809-10814). So this component takes ONE input either way — the turn — and
// the two sources differ in exactly one thing: a live send carries its
// `Receipt[]` (blob thumbnails and all), a restored one rebuilds them from the
// `<pane-shot>` block its `raw` still holds.
