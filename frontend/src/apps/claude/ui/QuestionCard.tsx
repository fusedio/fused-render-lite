// `answers`, keyed by the exact question text, whose value is the chosen
// option's own `label`. There is deliberately no plain Allow (an allow with no
// answers reaches the model as "the user did not answer"), no "allow all in this
// reply" and no mode switch — a question is one exchange.
//
// Every string on the card is model-authored and goes in as a text node, with
// ONE deliberate exception: every question also gets an "Other" row this window
// adds (D407). The typed text rides a SEPARATE `custom` record rather than
// being smuggled in as a label, so `answers` stays strictly "a string the
// request itself offered".
