// THE ATTACHMENT SEAM: what the chip row, the viewer, the receipts and the
// "what was sent" popup need from the pipeline, and the few decisions that are
// the UI's own.
//
// The VOCABULARY IS NOT REDEFINED HERE. `shotNoun` / `shotAlt` / `sizeLabel` /
// `failLabel` / `receiptFor` / `receiptsFromWire` / `prunedLabel` come from
// `shots/attach.ts` and are re-exported, for the reason T keeps one copy of each
// (T:7067): "a pasted image called 'preview screenshot' in the receipt is a
// receipt that describes the wrong thing". What lives here is the drawing side —
// picture-or-glyph, door-or-not, what the viewer will open — plus `AttachApi`,
// the injectable face of the pipeline the tray calls.
//

 * spent handles are revoked a commit later, and no store write reaches a
 * snapshot — so the picture went blank under the user in the one place they had
 * opened it to look at it.
 *
 * So the snapshot is only ever an ADDRESS. `Viewable.id` is the attachment id
 * that survives the whole trip — the tray, the send's `inFlight` entry, the
 * receipt, the settled receipt (`settleReceipts` matches on it for the same
 * reason) — so the row is looked up FRESH: the tray first, because a pending
 * picture is the tray's, then the receipts under the sent bubbles.
 *
 * THE SNAPSHOT IS THE FALLBACK, for the one window where the picture is in
 * neither list: `take()` has emptied the tray and the bubble is not up yet.
 * Its handle is very much alive there, and so is a snapshot with no id at all —
 * a restored turn's receipt, which never had one.
