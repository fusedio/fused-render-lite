// The chat's IDENTITY LINE — T's `#topbar` (T:1285-1310, 4030-4083, inventory
// 04 §F): the Claude mark, "Claude", the target's name, then the task number and
// the "running" mark at the right end.
//
// IT USED TO BE TWO ROWS, and the first of them was a second control strip: back
// at its left end, the ⋮ at its right, and the seat PR2's screenshot button was
// meant to land in. T has no such row — its `#anntools` is ONE strip above both
// views carrying `← Chats`, the three preview seats and the ⋮ together, and
// `#chat.home #topbar` (T:1277) hides only THIS line on the landing. Rendering
// our own copy of the controls here put the seats on a row of their own above
// the row that held the menu (Akshil, 2026-09-09, P2-1), so back and the kebab
// moved up into the shared strip (`ClaudeChat`'s `.c-anntools`) and what is left
// is the identity, which is all T ever had here.
//
// The name is TASK-nnn and not a session hash: a session IS a task, 1:1, and
// TASK-023 is the identifier every other surface in this app prints, so a
// reader can carry it to the Tasks page and quote it to someone (T:12660-12672).
//
// AND ONCE THE LISTING HAS A ROW FOR THIS SESSION, the whole line is the TASK
// SIDE PEEK'S identity block instead (Akshil, 2026-09-14): the status ring, the
// number, the task's title and the project it runs in. The ✻ Claude wordmark and
// the target's path are facts about the tool and the file — true, and printed
// twice over elsewhere on the page — where the reader's question in a chat is
// "which conversation am I in, and how is it doing". The peek answers exactly
// that, so the chat borrows the peek's own component rather than growing a
// second header that must be kept looking like it.

// two different headers (Akshil, 2026-09-14). Its CSS is `styles/task-peek.css`,
// which the shell loads for every page through `shell.css` — the chat draws
// inside that document, so there is nothing to import here.
// THE LIST'S OWN STATUS RING AND THE LIST'S OWN CAPTION. A queued task wears a
// dashed ring on the Tasks page (`schedule-ring--queued`, styles/schedule.css)
// followed by its place in the line (`QueueCaptionText`), and the chat header
// now wears both — reused rather than restated, so the two cannot drift into two
// vocabularies for one state (the drift this whole header was written against).
//
// AND IN THE SAME ORDER THE ROW READS IN: ring, number, title, caption, left to
// right (Akshil, 2026-09-18). The first cut hung the ring and the words off the
// RIGHT end of the header, in the usage limit's red seat — which made one state
// look like two different objects on two surfaces three pixels apart, and made
