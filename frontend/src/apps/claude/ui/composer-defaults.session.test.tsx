// WHICH CONVERSATION THE PILLS ARE ABOUT (Akshil, 2026-09-18: "what I select as
// a user stays").
//
// The composer ranked `param > detected > pref > constant`, and `detected` used
// to be a question about a FOLDER: `agent._defaults(file)` reads the model last
// used anywhere in it. Every door into a chat asked it that way, so the same
// conversation reached from the Tasks peek, from that peek's Open button, from a
// row, from the chat list or from a bare URL could each be told a different
// thing — and a model the reader had picked in THIS chat lost to whatever some
// other chat in the same folder ran with more recently.
//
// Two halves to the fix, and both are pinned below. The question gains a
// SUBJECT: every route ends at this hook and this hook names the session, so all
// of them ask about one conversation. And the answer gains a RECORD, which the
// app writes itself on every spawn, every send and every pill pick — so it is
// complete where the transcript is not, exists before the transcript does, and
// ranks above the `?model=`/`?effort=` params a deep link seeded. The agent half
// is pinned in `tests/test_claude_sessions_merged.py`; this is the half that has
// to ASK, and now also the half that has to WRITE.
