// THE CHIP ROW above the composer: what this message is about to carry
// (T:7129 `shotChip`, T:7192 `shotThumbBtn`, markup T:4154/4220, CSS T:896-988).
//
// THE WHOLE CHIP IS THE DOOR (Akshil, 2026-09-09, P2-4). 22 pixels can prove a
// picture EXISTS and nothing that size can show what is in it, so one click
// opens it full size where the user can read it and, if it is the wrong moment,
// throw it away from there (T:7121-7128). What changed is the HIT AREA: the port
// made a door of the 22px thumbnail alone (and, for a file, of the glyph alone),
// so the name and the size beside it — most of the pill, and the part a pointer
// actually lands on — were dead. Thumb, glyph and words are now one `<button>`
// filling the pill, with the ✕ as its only sibling; the pill's own hover moves
// with it, so the affordance is the shape the pointer is over.
//
// The same pill an annotation's chip is (`.annchip`), because both are things
// this message is about to carry and both come off with the same ✕ — one row
// reading "what is attached" rather than two features that happen to be
// neighbours (T:927-932). `shotchip` is only the entrance-animation hook.
