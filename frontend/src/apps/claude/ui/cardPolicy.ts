// is live. The user's click is the only thing that opens a card, and it STICKS
// across the 400 ms poll, a repair branch and a history replay.
//
// Overrides are keyed rather than held on the element (or in component state),
// because a re-render can discard the node: a tool call is keyed by its
// `tool_use` id — stable across every re-render of that call — and a thinking
// segment, which has no id, by its position inside a numbered container.
//
// ONE MAP PER MOUNT, handed down through a context. A module-global map is what
// the template could afford — one page, one chat — but six compact mounts share
// this module on the cards wall, and there the keys COLLIDE by construction
// (`seq:index`, and `tool:<id>` for the same tool call replayed in two cards):
// same-keyed chips opened in lockstep across the wall, and one card's Back
// wiped the collapse policy of the other five.
