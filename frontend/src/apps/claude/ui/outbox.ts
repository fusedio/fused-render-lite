// THE PAGE'S OUTBOX — the lines the reader typed while this page could not
// hand them to the run yet.
//
// Claude Code's own terminal never refuses Enter: a line typed while it works
// goes into a visible queue above the input, the box clears, and the queue
// drains in order. This page had no such thing — `dispatchSend` held a latch
// for the start round trip / the pane capture / the queue admission, and the
// composer's `submit` returned `false` for the whole window with no sign at all.
// The words stayed in the box, the reader kept typing, and the next Enter sent
// two messages glued together (multi-send QA, 2026-09-19: "2nd lost", "3rd
// swallowed").
//
// This module is the queue itself and nothing else: an ordered list with the
// four moves the page makes on it. Pure and React-free so the ordering rules
// are unit-tested without mounting a chat. Every function returns a NEW array
// (the page mirrors the list into state for rendering, and a mutated array is a
// paint React never sees).
//
// ORDER RULES, the whole contract:
//   * `pushBack`  — a line typed while busy waits its turn, behind the others.
//   * `pushFront` — a line handed BACK (a send that failed, an interrupt's
//                   `still_queued`) goes ahead of everything typed since: it was
//                   said first.
//   * `shiftOldest` — the drain takes from the front, one at a time.
//   * `popNewest`   — ↑ in an empty box pulls back the LAST thing typed, the
//                   way Claude Code's ↑ does (up again for an older one).
