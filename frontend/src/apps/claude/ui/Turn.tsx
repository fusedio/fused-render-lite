 * NEVER NULL (Akshil 2026-09-15). A folded turn draws this line and nothing
 * else, so a null answer is a row with a mark, a fold, and no words at all —
 * a control the reader can only work by pressing it to find out. Every road
 * out ends in a noun: the prose, then the first tool call's summary, then the
 * KIND of the first segment ("Thinking" for a reply that only thought,
 * "Interrupted" for one that was cut off), and finally "Response" for a turn
 * with nothing in it whatsoever. The fallbacks are muted because none of them
 * is the answer — they say what the row IS, not what it said.
