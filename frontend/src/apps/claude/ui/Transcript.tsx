// The scrollport (T:12752-13060).
//
// A PLAIN DIV, not `ScrollArea`: the follow-bottom rules below read
// `scrollTop`/`scrollHeight`/`clientHeight` off the scroller itself and write
// `scrollTop` back, and every one of the gesture distinctions depends on those
// being the element the browser actually scrolls.
//
// Three rules, and each exists because the obvious version of it leaked:
//   * follow is GESTURE-based and threshold-free for wheel and touch. A 20px
//     drag stays inside any "near bottom" window, so geometry read the touch as
//     re-arming the follow it was trying to break;
//   * a scroll CLAMP is not a gesture. The tail shrinks all the time (a chip
//     resolving to a smaller image, the working line leaving at run end), and
//     reading the browser's clamp as "the reader moved up" was the other way
//     the follow died mid-turn;
//   * growth is OBSERVED, not announced. Most of what lands in a live turn
//     grows AFTER the append that scrolled — a chip that expands when its
//     output arrives, a code block growing as the highlighter runs, a picture
//     that only takes up room once it loads — so a ResizeObserver answers all
//     of them with the one flag.
