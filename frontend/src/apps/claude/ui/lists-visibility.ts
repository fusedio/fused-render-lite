 * A module-level `let`, which is what T's `listTab` is: `Lists` unmounts the

 * always returned to "Recent chats". Hoisting it into `ClaudeChat` would not do
 * either — the mounted chat is remounted by a mode switch, and T's own variable
 * outlives that too. It lives as long as the page, which is exactly T's scope.
 *
 * `computeLists` already falls the selection back to the first filled tab when
 * the remembered one has since emptied, so a stale name here is never a blank
 * panel.
 *
 * KEYED ON THE TARGET, not one variable for the document (batch review F3). A
 * bare `let` was right for T, whose scope is one page = one target, and wrong
 * here for the reason P4-06 exists: native renders the cards wall, Peek and the
 * split pane in ONE document, so a single variable meant picking "Artifacts" in
 * one tile changed what a DIFFERENT tile showed on its next landing — and the
 * memory also survived a target change, which T's `listTab` could not. The key
 * is `agentDir + file`, the shape `useArtifacts` and the snapshots cache both
 * use. `computeLists` still saves an emptied tab from being a blank panel; it
 * cannot save it from being the wrong one.
