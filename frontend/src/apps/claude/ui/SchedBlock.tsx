// THE BANNER A BLOCKED COMPOSER WEARS (T:4122-4147 markup, T:17088-17165
// `renderSchedBlock`, CSS T:1472-1671; inventory 05 §C).
//
// A BANNER, NOT A MODAL: the transcript stays readable and the session list
// stays reachable. It carries ONE action, and that action is whichever one
// actually reopens the box — cancel for a one-off, stop-the-repeat for a repeat
// (cancelling an occurrence of a repeat unblocks nothing, because `_materialize`
// arms the next one and it blocks again). "Edit schedule" used to sit beside it
// and is GONE (Akshil, 2026-08-17), and so is the row's own press: it used to
// hop to the Tasks page, first onto the calendar and then into this task's side
// peek — which is the chat the reader is already in. "What's the point of
// linking it if it opens the same task?" (Akshil, 2026-09-21). So the row is a
// READING — what is coming and when — and the button beside it is the one
// control on the card.
//
// WHAT IT SHOWS is the Tasks LIST view's own row — a status ring, TASK-nnn, the
// name, and the state and time at the right end — because a reader who knows
// the Tasks page already knows how to read this row, and reusing that vocabulary
// is what makes the banner a view of the schedule rather than a paragraph about
// it. NOT on the row: the folder and the session id. "You will not show the
// folder because you are already in that folder, you are not showing the session
// ID because you are already there" (Akshil, 2026-08-17).
