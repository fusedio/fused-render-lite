// More options (⋮) — the chat's one menu (T:4003-4032 markup,
// T:13120-13470 behaviour, inventory 04 §F).
//
// THREE items, exactly the template's: the terminal hand-off, Archive/Unarchive
// and Delete this task. "What was sent" was a fourth here for one revision and
// is gone (Akshil, 2026-09-08): T opens that panel from a RECEIPT ROW under the
// bubble it belongs to, where "what was sent" names one turn — in a menu that
// hangs off the whole conversation the same three words name nothing in
// particular, and the reader has to guess which turn they would get.
//
// ON THE LANDING PAGE the menu is REAL and has one item — "New session in
// terminal" (T's `#kebabpop` home state, T:13415). It was drawn inert here,
// which is the one thing a control must never be: the item that does exist
// there needs no session, it hands the FOLDER to a terminal.
//
// Every label is decided at OPEN time because each names
// something that changes without a reload: the session param (the terminal
// item's verb), and the task behind this chat (whether the archive item exists
// at all, and which way it reads). `applyArchiveOpt` draws from what the page
// already knows, SYNCHRONOUSLY, so the item is in the menu's first paint;
// `refreshArchiveOpt` then re-reads the listing and corrects a WORD rather than
// the menu's height (T:13130-13140, 2026-08-24).
