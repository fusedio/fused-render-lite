// `setText` behind the send's `markDeleted` and the spent sentence came back as
// a scheduled follow-up. And a copy that failed was simply dropped: the hop
// minted and navigated with a partial (even empty) set, wiping the attachments
// the record was holding, where "Save as draft" had always refused.
