// The drawing is the point of most of this file. T:296 hides the Comment seat's
// spare glyph and spare word with no `.on` override anywhere in the sheet, and
// T:7689 says why: "a label that changes width makes the whole right-anchored
// row shuffle on every toggle, and one mode wearing two names reads as two
// features". Since P2-1 moved this strip into the header row beside the ⋮, a
// re-widthing seat also walks the menu's right edge. So the seat's SPOKEN name
// changes across five states and its rendered text does not change at all —
// which is exactly the pair of assertions below.
//
// react-test-renderer, the RecControls.test.tsx pattern: no DOM, so the tests
// read rendered props rather than computed styles.
