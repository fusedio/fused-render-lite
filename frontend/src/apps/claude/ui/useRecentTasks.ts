 * in the view that raised it: a claim exists to OUTRUN the read that will
 * confirm it, and the list that made it is remounted by every trip into a chat
 * and back — a store inside the hook would be thrown away by the very answer it

 *   * neither — the listing HAS answered and has no row for this session, which
