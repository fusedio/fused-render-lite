// THE `#anncta` GROUP: the three controls that act on the PREVIEW rather than on
// the draft — Screenshot · Comment · Annotate (T:3975-4000 markup, CSS
// T:195-320).
//
// The camera was a pill beside Send in both composers and moved up here on
// 2026-08-27, because it acts on the pane like its two neighbours; the picture it
// takes still lands as a chip above the composer, where the message is. The
// order is Screenshot first (Akshil, 2026-09-04).
//
// WHERE the group lives is a layout question and the answer is the pane's
// (`pickerHost`, pane/LeftModePicker): the strip is the one row BOTH narrow views
// keep, and the wide layout's chat column keeps it too — so the group renders
// once, in the chat column's strip, and the narrow CHAT view hides the two seats
// whose pane is parked off screen there: the camera (T:3823 `body.view-chat
// .viewshot`, nothing to photograph) and Comment (T:3822 `body.view-chat #annbtn`,
// nothing to pin onto). Annotate stays — a spoken walkthrough is about the app
// the reader is describing, not about what is currently on screen.
//
// PR3 gave Comment and Annotate their handlers. Three rules that are the whole
// of this file's own behaviour:
//
//   * ONE SEAT, THREE SPOKEN NAMES for Comment and exactly ONE DRAWING
//     (T:7695 `annBtnName`): the `aria-label`/`title` become the arm, the ✓ Done
//     that sends the round, and the resting name a walkthrough leaves it with —
//     while the glyph and the visible word never change, because a seat that
//     re-widths shuffles this whole right-anchored row on every toggle (T:7689).
//     The accent fill says armed; the way OUT is the bar's ■/✓, never a
//     neighbouring seat.
//   * ABSENT BEATS DEAD: with nothing to annotate all three seats are HIDDEN,
//     not disabled (T:238-241, 8447) — a dead row of three is worse than a row
//     that is not there.
//   * INERT IS SPOKEN, not only drawn (`seatsAria`, T:6816): the stylesheet dims
//     the camera and the mic while a comment round is armed
//     (`.c-anncta:has(.c-annbtn.on) .c-viewshot`, T:320) and `aria-disabled`
//     says the same thing to a reader who cannot see the dimming.
