// A MESSAGE THIS CHAT HAS NOT SENT YET, drawn as what it is: the reader's own
// bubble, at its place in the conversation, with a dashed edge where a sent one
// has a filled ground (the project queue, prefs `queue.enabled`).
//
// WHAT IT REPLACES. Until 2026-09-12 this was a CHIP — a card with a ring, a
// status word, a place ("#2 in line"), a Skip and a Cancel, parked under the
// transcript. It said everything and belonged to nothing: a second kind of object
// in a column of bubbles, describing a message that was sitting right above it in
// a bubble of its own. The reader had to pair the two up before either meant
// anything, and on a narrow pane the card's own row of controls squeezed the
// sentence it existed to say.
//
// THE SHAPE NOW IS THE TRANSCRIPT'S OWN. The message is a user bubble, because it
// is a user message; it is TRANSPARENT WITH A DASHED BORDER, because it has not
// happened yet; and the one thing a bubble cannot say — that it is waiting, what
// for, and how to take it back — is one muted line underneath, in the smallest
// register this pane has.
//
// NOT FADED. A dashed edge says "not yet"; dimmed text says "less important", and
// these are the reader's own words, which are not. The distinction was made
// explicitly (Akshil, 2026-09-12) and it is why the bubble keeps full-strength
// ink while the LINE under it is the muted one.
