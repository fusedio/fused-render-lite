// "What was sent": the composed message a receipt stands for, on demand
// (T:10965-11045, 4403-4413).
//
// A receipt is a summary; this is the RECORD — the overview screenshot (badges
// and all), each comment with its label, anchor, timing and no-badge caveat, the
// other attached pictures, and the exact composed text. T stashes a live payload
// on the receipt at send time and rebuilds a restored turn's from the wire
// (T:10932); here there is only the second road, because `UserTurn.raw` IS the
// wire and every section below is a `parseInbound` away from it — ONE source, so
// a live popup and a reopened one cannot say different things.
//
// THE DOOR IS THE RECEIPT (R4-1). This box is opened by clicking the receipt
// line under the bubble it belongs to — "screenshot attached", "image
// attached: …" — T's own affordance (T:11059
// `row.title = "Click to see exactly what was sent to the agent"`, T:1249), not
// a second control beside it. `ui/Turn` and `ui/Receipts` own those presses.
//
// AND IT WEARS THE APP'S MODAL CHROME, not a skin of its own: the shared
// `platform/ui/modal/Modal` chassis, the same one `EraseTaskModal` (the Delete
// task dialog this chat's kebab opens) uses — same overlay, same card, same
// head with the ✕, same focus trap and Esc/backdrop close. Before this it was a
// shadcn `Dialog` with a hand-rolled bar and pill, so the two dialogs the same
// menu could put on screen looked like they came from different apps.
