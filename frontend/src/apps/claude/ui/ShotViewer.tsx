// ONE PICTURE, FULL SIZE, IN THE APP'S OWN MODAL (T:4369-4397 markup,
// T:10681-10805 behaviour, CSS T:997-1140).
//
// The other half of the report that produced the chip: a 22px thumbnail proved a
// screenshot existed and there was "no way to preview it before sending", so
// what the user was asked to do was trust a smudge and press send. Every
// thumbnail the chat draws opens this, pending or sent, through one builder.
//
// THE CHASSIS IS `platform/ui/modal/Modal` (Akshil, 2026-09-09, P2-3) — the same
// one the kebab's Delete task dialog (`platform/ui/EraseTaskModal`) and "what was
// sent" (`ui/SentPop`) use. T's viewer was an overlay of its own with a bar along
// the bottom holding the path, Discard and Close; ported as a shadcn `Dialog`
// with that bar hand-rolled inside it, it was the third dialog design the same
// conversation could put on screen, and its box was sized by its CONTENT — so a
// framed file preview overflowed the card and pushed the bar, Discard included,
// past the bottom of the viewport (P2-5). The chassis brings the overlay, the
// card, the head with the ✕, the footer, the focus trap, the backdrop and Esc —
// and a card that is `max-height: 85vh` with a scrolling body, which is the
// whole of the overflow report. What is T's own and stays is inside the body.
//
// ESCAPE PEELS ONE LAYER, and the chassis owns that now. This viewer opens OVER
// "what was sent", and the port took the key in the CAPTURE phase and stopped it
// so one press could not dismiss both. `modal/esc-stack` is that same rule
// written once for every caller of the chassis — only the topmost registered
// modal reacts — so the phase games go with the overlay they belonged to.
//
// TWO SIZES, and the second is not a nicety: fitted, a 1600px capture lands at
// ~310px in the sidebar — four times the chip, still not enough to read the UI
// it is a picture OF. One click on the image swaps to natural size with the box
// scrolling, which is the only way a narrow column can show a wide screenshot at
// a legible scale (T:1030-1048).
