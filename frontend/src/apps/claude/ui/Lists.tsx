   * — and a chat about another file does not belong in this pane at all, so the
   * HOST is sent to that file with the session attached (T:18183-18188).

   * `taskPane` is the second case's test and its path in one answer (""
   * means "this pane"), and `paneChatUrl` is the same URL the Tasks list opens
   * a task on. A task with no session yet — a never-sent draft — has no chat to
   * open either way, and gets no press at all: `TaskRowItem` draws that row
   * inert rather than lit and dead.
   *
   * A LOCKED BLOCK REFUSES EVERY ROW (P4-23): no press and no href, so the
   * stretched link cannot navigate either.
   *
   * AND AN UPCOMING ROW OPENS ITS CARD (Akshil, 2026-09-16). A DRAFT goes to the
   * New task card on its own record, through the host — `onFillDraft` is handed
   * the ROW and `list-rows.draftHref` decides the URL, so the press is the same
   * one the Tasks page makes and there is exactly one of it to learn. A
   * SCHEDULED-LATER row — not a draft, one message waiting — opens the Edit task
   * card on that message, which is the same card the Tasks page opens for it,
   * SESSION OR NO SESSION: a scheduled follow-up on a thread is still a message
   * that has not gone out, and its row's press is still the card (Bugbot,
   * PR #1180).
   *
   * The two intervening rounds are worth naming so neither comes back. Round 1
   * made a draft a door out of the app; round 2 made it no door at all ("fill
   * the composer, caret after the text") — which read as the row doing nothing
   * from any host but the landing, and left the row in the composer's OWN
   * folder behaving differently from its neighbours. One record, one card, one
   * press.
   *
   * Neither `isChatDraftTask` nor `draft_id` is consulted here: the two kinds of
   * draft differ only in how their record is addressed, which is a question this
   * list does not ask.
   *
   * …AND A QUEUED CHAT OPENS ITS CHAT (PR #1124, merged 2026-09-17). A message
   * a reader typed into a composer and that is waiting behind somebody else's
   * run in the same folder is not a draft and not a form: it has no record to
