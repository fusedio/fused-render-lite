// ExitPlanMode — the model asking to stop planning and start doing the work
// (T:14476-14615). Not an approval either: what is parked is a PLAN, and the
// two answers are "go ahead" and "keep planning".
//
//   * Approve plan sends a plain `allow`; the CLI leaves plan mode itself when
//     it sees one. A `mode` rides along ONLY when the picker already sits on a
//     looser mode, which is then the mode the session should land in;
//   * Keep planning sends a `deny` plus the optional note. The SENTENCE the
//     model reads is composed by agent.py — the note is the only part this card
//     contributes, and it is never written back into the page;
//   * there is no "allow all in this reply": there is one plan, and a session
//     grant would pre-approve the next one unseen.
//
// The plan is the ONE payload on any card rendered as markdown, because it is
// the one that genuinely IS markdown — a tool input is bytes off a disk, a plan
// is prose the model wrote for the user to read (D248).
