  // ---- THE DRAFT, AND THE TWO BOXES THAT KEEP ONE DIFFERENTLY -------------
  //
  // The key is the session, or `new:<file>` while the chat has not got one yet
  // (chatDraftKey) — the same key the Tasks card edits the record under, so a
  // draft made here and a draft opened there are one record with one name.
  //
  // AND THE KEY IS ALSO WHICH RULE THIS BOX LIVES BY (Akshil, 2026-09-16):
  //
  //   * ON A SESSION — a finished task, a blocked one, a run in progress, an
  //     archived conversation — this composer is WHERE that chat's unsent
  //     message is. The ✎ Draft chip on the row points at it and nothing else
  //     shows it, so the box has to hold what was left in it. Everything the
  //     draft ever did stands: it seeds from the record on mount, autosaves 600
  //     ms after the last keystroke, flushes on blur and on `pagehide`, adopts
  //     what another tab wrote, empties when the record goes, and its Send
  //     spends the draft. Nothing asks on the way out, because nothing here is
  //     ever unsaved.
  //   * WITH NO SESSION YET there is no chat for a record to be the unsent
  //     message OF — what the words would become is an UPCOMING ROW on the Tasks
  //     card, and a box that autosaved into that list minted a task out of every
  //     half-typed thought. So this one writes nothing on its own and opens
  //     empty, and the single moment its words can be lost — leaving — asks the
  //     question instead ("Unsent message": save as draft, discard, cancel), with
  //     `beforeunload`/`pagehide` under it.
  //
  //     AND WHAT IT SAVES IS A TASK DRAFT, `draft:<id>`, minted fresh every time
  //     (`composerTaskDraft`; Akshil, 2026-09-16). It used to be this box's
  //     `new:<file>` key — one record per FOLDER — so the second thing the
  //     reader saved out of a folder landed on top of the first. `draftKey`
  //     below is therefore only the SESSION road's key now; the other road never
  //     writes under it, and nothing else in this app does either.
