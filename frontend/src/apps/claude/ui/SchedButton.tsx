// "Schedule this as a task" — the HANDOFF, and the handoff is one button
// (T:11940-12035, 12075-12128).
//
// The composer used to try to schedule on its own; everything past a bare
// deferral is the /tasks page's form, so what travels is what the page cannot
// know and this composer always does: WHICH DRAFT this is, and where to come
// back to. That is the whole of the URL now — `?new=1&draft=<chat key>&from=…`
// — because the words themselves no longer travel at all.
//
// WHY NOTHING TRAVELS ANY MORE (design "Drafts: one record, one key, versioned,
// pushed", §1). The hop used to carry the sentence three ways at once: a
// sessionStorage stash, a `?message=` param, and a `draft:<id>` the task form
// minted on arrival — three copies of one half-written thing, and every bug in
// this feature was two of them disagreeing. The draft IS a server record with a
// key; the key is all that has to cross a navigation, and both ends open the
// same record.
//
// WHAT THE BUTTON STILL DOES BEFORE LEAVING is copy the tray into the task-shots
// dir (`copyToTaskShots`) and save that onto the record, because a chat
// attachment's path is a tempdir on a 12 h TTL and `POST /api/schedule` refuses
// any path outside `schedule.shots_dir()`. The bytes are the one thing a key
// cannot stand in for.
