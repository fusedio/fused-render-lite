// input and output are raw bytes — a file's contents, a command's stdout, an
// MCP server's answer — and only `text`, `thinking` and a plan are prose.
//
// The funnel itself lives in protocol/markdown.ts (marked → DOMPurify, never
// marked alone). This component is the render site and the code-block pass.
