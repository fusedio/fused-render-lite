// R4-1: THE RECEIPT IS THE DOOR.
//
// A receipt row under a bubble (a picture, a note) says the message carried
// more than the bubble shows, so it is the line that opens the panel
// showing that "more" — the affordance T ships (T:11059 `row.title = "Click to
// see exactly what was sent to the agent"`, T:1249). What this pins:
//
//   * a turn with a receipt AND a differing wire draws the receipt as a real
//     `button` carrying that title, and no second "what was sent" control;
//   * pressing it hands the WHOLE turn to `onShowSent` (the panel reads `raw`
//     off it, so the wrong turn would show the wrong message);
//   * a receipt with nothing extra behind it stays inert text — a door into a
//     room that is just the bubble again would be a lie;
//   * a turn with a differing wire but NO receipt has no door at all — the
//     hover control that used to stand in for one is gone everywhere (P3R1-7);
//   * and the panel itself wears the shared modal chassis — the Delete task
//     dialog's chrome — rather than a dialog skin of its own.
