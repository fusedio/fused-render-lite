// The pages Claude published DURING THIS CHAT, as a chip strip above the
// footnote (T:4203, T:18570-18632; inventory 05 §F).
//
// ACCUMULATING, keyed by url: the poll reads the transcript of whichever session
// is current, and a chip must not vanish because a turn ended or a later read
// raced. Cleared only by leaving for the landing page — a different
// conversation's pages are not this one's — or by a reload.
//
// The strip is DECORATION driven off the reply's own clock: `onArtifactsTick`
// fires every 8th poll (~3.2 s) and once at the run's end, which is where T
// hangs it (T:16229, 16330). A read that fails is a console line, never an
// interruption of the poll for the reply.
