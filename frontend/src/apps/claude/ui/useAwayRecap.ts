// THE AWAY TIMER behind the "While you were away" fold (Claude Code's "Session
// recap", `awaySummaryEnabled`; .claude-design/session-recap.md).
//
// Two events, not one, and each covers what the other cannot:
//   * `visibilitychange` is the tab being hidden — another tab, another Space,
//     the machine asleep. It does NOT fire when the window merely loses focus,
//     which is the ordinary way a reader steps away from a chat they left open;
//   * window `blur`/`focus` is that case — and it fires for things that are not
//     leaving at all (a devtools click, an OS dialog), which is exactly why the
//     threshold below is a MINUTE rather than a moment.
//
// So both are bound and they share one clock: whichever says "gone" first
// starts it, whichever says "back" first reads it. Coming back with the clock
// unset is a non-event — a `focus` with no `blur` before it happens on plenty
// of boots — and it is silently ignored rather than treated as a zero-length
// absence.
//
// AND IT IS ONE PAGE'S RETURN, not one mount's. The gates below are mostly
// about this chat; three of them are about the PAGE, because `focus` is heard
// by every chat the shell has mounted and not by the one the reader is looking
// at: the host has to opt in (ClaudeChat's `recap`), the mount has to be on
// screen (`recapRootVisible`), and the first to fire takes the return
// (`SAME_RETURN_MS`). Without them one return bought seven model calls, six for
// folds inside cards nobody opens.
//
// FETCHED ON RETURN, never on the way out. Claude Code generates on blur
// because it can fork its own warm cache; ours is a fresh model call on the
// server, so paying for a reader who never comes back is a cost with no reader
// at the end of it (design, "Data model (ours)").
