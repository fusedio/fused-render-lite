// THE HEADER'S QUEUED STATE — the dashed ring and the sentence the Tasks row
// has always worn, in the pane that is actually waiting.
//
// The bug (Akshil, 2026-09-17): a send into a busy folder drew the dashed bubble
// and the "1 message queued" pill, and the header above them — `Claude · alpha
// · T048` — said nothing at all. A chat waiting behind somebody else's run
// looked exactly like an idle one, while the Tasks list three pixels away showed
// the state plainly.
//
// …AND THE FIX'S OWN BUG (Akshil, 2026-09-18): the first cut hung the ring and
// the words off the RIGHT end of the line, in the usage limit's red seat, after
// the task number — so one state read as two different objects on two surfaces
// three pixels apart, and waiting read as failing. The header is now the Tasks
// ROW'S order, which is what this file asserts: ring, TASK-nnn, title, caption,
// left to right, and the project at the far end.
//
// WHAT IS ASSERTED is only what could drift: the ORDER, that the words are
// `queueCaption`'s (never a second wording minted here), that the ring is the
// LIST's ring class (`schedule-ring--queued`) and the caption the LIST's caption
// classes (`tasks-row-queue` / `tasks-queue-text`), that the usage limit's red
// span is not borrowed for it, and that a row which is not queued draws none of
// it.
