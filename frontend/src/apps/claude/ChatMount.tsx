// Props are the union of what the 4 ChatFrame sites and the 2 plain-iframe sites
// pass (00 §1a/§1b); the URL shapes themselves live in `legacy-src.ts` behind a
// byte-for-byte parity test.
//
// WHY THE HOST STILL BUILDS `legacySrc` rather than this component building it:
// the two wrappers around it — `withNoFocus` and `revSrc` — are facts about the
// HOST (a thumbnail shell, a git revision being previewed), and the sites that
// need them apply them at their own level today. Threading them through here
// would buy nothing and would make the parity guard argue about wrappers
// instead of about addresses.

 * chat and its markdown stack (marked + DOMPurify + highlight.js, 75 kB gz)
 * into the shell's entry graph, flag off, for routes that never mount one.
 *
 * The tri-state flag already has to hold a placeholder over this box while the

 * is a wait that already exists: `Suspense` falls back to the same skeleton, and
