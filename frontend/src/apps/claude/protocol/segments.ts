// The segment model, as pure data. `T`'s `renderSegments` (T:15650-15727) is a
// DOM reconciler: it keeps a per-container `{views, typed, seq}` and mutates
// elements in place. React needs the same decisions expressed as values — which
// index is the growing tail, what each row's collapse key is, and how much of
// the replayed turn belongs to THIS bubble — so that is what this file is.
//
// The rules it preserves, one per T cite:
//   * poll replays the WHOLE turn every 400 ms, so everything here is
//     idempotent and keyed, never appended (T:15650).
//   * ONLY a `text` segment at the very END of the list is still growing; one
//     anywhere else is finished by definition (T:15664-15667).
//   * a tool row's identity is its `tool_use` id — stable across every
//     re-render of that call; a thinking/text/notice row has no id and is keyed
//     by POSITION inside a numbered container (T:15207-15215, cardKey T:15234).
//   * `segments` is authoritative; `data.text` is the flat legacy field and is
//     NOT rendered as well when segments exist, or the reply prints twice
//     (T:16262-16268).
//   * a payload can hold MORE THAN ONE reply — a follow-up absorbed mid-turn
//     leaves both in the same window (D687) — so the SEAMS come from the poll
//     (`turn_breaks`, agent.py `_absorbed_turn_breaks`) and the caller slices
//     the payload before handing a span to `pollBody`. Nothing here guesses a
//     boundary; the old frozen `segBase`/`textBase` pair did, and got it wrong
//     by however much of the first reply streamed after the send (feedback #9).

/* ── collapsible runs (design.md §A) ────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A turn that makes fifteen edits is fifteen chips, and fifteen chips are a
 * wall the prose either side of them disappears into. v1 folded them under an
 * `N tool calls` header; that traded fifteen rows for one row, and one row is
 * still a row the reader did not ask for. v2 takes the row away entirely: the
 * stretch collapses behind a `show more` trigger that sits on the RIGHT EDGE of
 * the sentence before it (ui/RunTrigger), so a settled turn is prose and
 * nothing else until the reader asks.
 *
 * WHAT COLLAPSES: any consecutive stretch of `tool` | `thinking` | `notice`,
 * in ANY MIX, down to a SINGLE member — a lone settled chip gets the trigger
 * too, because the goal is zero machinery rows inline and one chip is one such
 * row. There is no `RUN_MIN` any more.
 *
 * THREE THINGS BREAK A RUN, and each one is a thing the reader is owed:
 *
 *   * a `text` segment — prose between two calls means they did not happen
 *     together (and anything a newer agent.py invents renders as text, so it
 *     breaks a run for the same reason);
 *   * a segment with a filed card in `cardsAfter` — the permission or plan the
 *     reader answered under that chip. The card is glued to its chip
 *     (Transcript's `parkPlan`, #18), so the chip stays individual and the run
 *     ends BEFORE it; the members after it are free to start a new one;
 *   * the end of the list.
 *
 * AND TWO THINGS SUPPRESS ONE (v1's bugbot fix, kept): a stretch holding a tool
 * that is not KNOWN SETTLED — running, or wearing a status this file has no
 * literal for — renders member by member, because while the turn is live the
 * progress is the point; and, while the turn is still streaming, the stretch
 * that runs to the END of the list, because that is the only stretch that can
 * still GROW and a lid that goes on when the second call settles comes straight
 * back off when the third lands. A stretch with any segment AFTER it is closed —
 * the poll only ever appends — so folding that one is final. Suppressed means
 * the members are emitted individually WITH NO TRIGGER, exactly as before.
 *
 * RAW INDICES THROUGHOUT. Every row carries the index it had in the list that
 * was handed in — `cardsAfter`, `cardKey` and the streaming tail are all keyed
 * by position in THAT list — so a hole in the array is a run breaker that is
 * dropped from the output without moving anything around it.
 */

/* ── where a run's trigger sits (design.md §A, Q1 revised 2026-09-15) ───────
 *
 * The trigger belongs in the bottom-right corner of a PROSE block, never on a
 * line of its own — a bare right-aligned word above the first paragraph is the
 * machinery row §A exists to delete, wearing a smaller hat.
 *
 * So a run seats itself on the prose it is adjacent to:
 *
 *   * the prose BEFORE it, wherever there is one (the original rule);
 *   * failing that — the turn OPENS on tool calls — the prose that FOLLOWS it,
 *     which gets the same corner seat. Only the run before the turn's FIRST
 *     prose looks forward: anywhere else "no prose before me" means a card or a
 *     bare stretch broke the chain, and reaching over that is reaching over
 *     something the reader is owed.
 *
 * A prose block can therefore hold TWO runs, one either side. It does NOT grow
 * two words in one corner: they MERGE onto one trigger, which opens both — and
 * the members of each render at their own chronological position, the leading
 * run's above the prose and the trailing run's below it.
 *
 * Looking BACKWARD, a prose block is not a seat when it is the STREAMING TAIL
 * (the corner of a paragraph still being written) or when it has a card filed
 * after it (the card is between the prose and the run). Those runs keep the
 * bare own-line trigger, as does a turn with no prose in it at all. Looking
 * FORWARD the tail IS a seat — see `seat()` below.

/* ── the lead sentence a leading run's trigger sits on (Akshil, 2026-09-15) ──
 *
 * A run BEFORE the turn's first prose seats its `show more` on that prose —
 * but on its FIRST SENTENCE, not its last line. The reader's eye is on the
 * opening sentence when they want to know what the machinery above it did;
 * a word in the corner of a five-line paragraph is a screen away from that.
 *
 * So the paint side splits the first prose segment into the lead sentence,
 * drawn as its own block carrying the trigger, and the rest. This is the pure
 * half: WHERE to cut.
 *
 *   * The cut is inside the FIRST PARAGRAPH only (up to the first blank line).
 *   * A paragraph that is a fenced block or a table is not a sentence: no
 *     split, the whole block keeps the corner seat it had.
 *   * A heading's line is the lead; a list's or quote's first ITEM is — up to
 *     the next marker at column 0, so an indented continuation stays with it.
 *   * Prose cuts at the first `.`, `!` or `?` (closing quotes/brackets kept)
 *     that is followed by whitespace and then something that is not a
 *     lowercase letter — `e.g. the`, `file.ts is` and `3.5 seconds` are not
 *     sentence ends — and that is not inside backticks.
 *   * No boundary in the paragraph → the whole paragraph is the lead.
 *   * Nothing left after the lead → null: there is nothing to split off, and
 *     the block is drawn once, whole, as before.
 *
 * While the tail streams the text is cut per frame: until the boundary's
 * trailing whitespace arrives the whole text is the lead, so the word sits at
 * the end of what has been typed and settles onto the first sentence the
 * moment there is one.

/**
 * Is this the same live chip as last poll, for rendering purposes? T:15549-15554
 * answers it with a key of `[status, output, images.length]` and spends five
 * lines on the omission:
 *
 *   "`input` is deliberately NOT in the key. It cannot change under a live chip
 *   — agent.py reads tool calls only from FINALIZED assistant rows, whose input
 *   is complete and deduped by tool id — and a Write's `content` is uncapped, so
 *   keying on it would re-stringify the whole file being written on every 400 ms
 *   poll for the rest of the turn. `output` is capped (4000 chars) and images
 *   contribute only their count, so what is left is cheap."
 *
 * Native had no equivalent: every poll built a fresh `seg` object, so
 * `ToolChip`'s `memo` never hit and a `Write` chip re-serialised its whole
 * `<pre>` body 2.5×/s for the length of the turn — with the `JSON.stringify` of
 * the uncapped `content` alongside it. Not a wrong-output bug; precisely the
 * cost T's rule exists to avoid.
 *
 * TOOL ROWS ONLY. For a text or thinking segment the body IS the content, so
 * "unchanged" would have to be a deep comparison of the very string that is
 * growing — the opposite of cheap, and those rows are the ones that genuinely
 * change on every poll.
