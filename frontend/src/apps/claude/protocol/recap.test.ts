// `recapAnchor` is not "the last user turn's uuid": it is "the last user turn
// the TRANSCRIPT DRAWS WITH AN ANCHOR". The two came apart in the browser and
// the fold's body became a dead click — the reader had interrupted the reply
// before stepping away, the CLI wrote `[Request interrupted by user]` as a
// user-role record with a real uuid, `Turn` drew it as a centred note with no
// `data-msg`, and the anchor named a row that does not exist to scroll to.
// (Verified against the QA transcript: six user rows, five `data-msg` turns,
// and the recap's `for_uuid` was the sixth.)
