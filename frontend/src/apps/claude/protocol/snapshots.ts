// Claude snapshots: the file-history checkpoint chain (SPEC §34, T:18641-19175,
// inventory 05 §F).
//
// This is Claude Code's OWN data — the very edit history the feature exists to
// protect — so the store stays strictly read-only and the one write goes through
// a two-call contract: `snapshot_plan` DESCRIBES (diff, counts, whether a copy
// of the current bytes will be kept) and `snapshot_revert` only ever applies the
// id the plan handed back. The page never names a version to the write itself.
//
// The reads decline both knobs (`deltas: "0"`, no enrichment) for the reason
// T measured: on a 453 KB file with 12 checkpoints the whole read is 292 ms, of
// which `difflib` inside `file_history._delta` is 290 — two numbers per row.
// Without them the read lands in ~6 ms, which is why the list is simply there
// rather than behind a door. The undiffed timeline softens its counts to NET
// lines, which is why `snapDeltaLabel` renders them with a tilde.

 * rather than refetching. What invalidates that cache is a WRITE: `snapGoBack`
 * repaints from the post-revert timeline the write itself returned, and a
 * finished turn drops it (`snapInvalidate`). A failed read caches nothing, so
 * the retry on the heading (and the next landing) asks again rather than leaving
 * the section stuck on the failure for the life of the page."
 *
 * Natively the panel's hook lives inside `Home`, which UNMOUNTS on the way into
 * a chat — so component state cannot be the cache and every Back spent the round
 * trip again. It lives here instead, at page scope, which is where T's
 * `snapLoaded`/`snapTimeline` pair lives.
 *
 * KEYED ON THE INVALIDATION VALUE as well as the file, and that is the load-
 * bearing half: `snapInvalidate` bumps a counter in the CHAT (which survives),
 * so by the time the panel remounts there is nothing left to compare a "has this
 * gone stale?" flag against. Storing the invalidation the entry was read under
 * turns that into a question the cache can answer on its own, on any mount.
 *
 * AND ON THE AGENT DIR TOO (batch review F4). `loadSnapshots` is a function of
 * BOTH arguments — the template folder holding `agent.py` decides which store
 * answers — so a key of `file` alone let two chats on the same file with
 * different template folders repaint each other's chain with no read of their
 * own, and `invalidateSnapshots(file)` dropped every folder's entry for it. The
 * composite key is the shape `useArtifacts` already uses.
