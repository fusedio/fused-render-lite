// The landing's "Recent chats" list: one read, then a long-poll that re-reads
// it the moment anything in this folder changes — a chat started or resumed in a
// TERMINAL included, which no poke from this page could ever know about
// (T:18340-18394 `watchRecent`, T:18399-18470 `loadRecent`).
//
// WHAT IT READS IS `/api/tasks` NOW, not agent.py's `sessions` action
// (.claude-design/design.md §B: "Recent chats = TaskList"). The list draws the
// Tasks page's own row, so it needs the Tasks page's own model — a `Task`, with
// the status, the title source, the unread count and the message count the row
// is made of, all decided by the server once for every view. The `sessions`
// action answered a thinner shape that only this list could read, and pairing
// it with a row built for `Task` would have meant inventing the missing halves
// here, which is exactly the client-side model the tasks endpoint exists to
// retire.
//
// THE READ AND THE WATCH ARE NO LONGER THIS MODULE'S, since 2026-09-15. Both
// live in `shell/tasksPulse.subscribeListing`, one `GET /api/tasks` and one
// `/api/tasks/changes` long-poll for the whole DOCUMENT — because this function
// ran per SUBSCRIPTION, a ClaudeChat mounts per card on the Tasks wall, and
// twelve cards therefore held twelve 25-second sockets against a browser cap of
// six. What stayed here is the only part that was ever about one subscription:
// `changeIsHere`, the question of whether a change is worth repainting THIS
// folder's list, which is the same question it always was.
//
// Semantics the UI depends on (05-sched-live-lists-boot.md §B):
//   * `null` is NOT `0`. `null` means "we do not have rows yet" and draws the
//     skeleton; `[]` means "this folder has no chats" and hides the section
//     entirely (T:18458-18463). A FAILED read is NEITHER and emits nothing at
//     all (Akshil QA, 2026-09-16) — it used to be `[]`, which emptied a drawn
//     list on one dropped read; see the `ev.failed` guard below.
//   * the rows are the WHOLE listing, unfiltered. Which of them this pane shows
//     is a question about paths, and paths are the row layer's vocabulary
//     (`ui/list-rows.taskInPane`); this module's only use for the pane is
//     deciding whether a change is worth a re-read.
//   * the skeleton stands in for rows we do not have, never for rows already
//     up: a re-read over a drawn list repaints in place (T:18411). That is why
//     this only ever emits `null` ONCE, before the first read lands.
//   * only the NEWEST read may write, because reads overlap by design (the back
//     handler retries over a just-left run's spawn window) — the same seat idiom
//     `sendSeq`/`loopSeq` use (T:18402-18407, Bugbot PR #653).
