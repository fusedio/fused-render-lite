// WHICH UNDRAINED FOLLOW-UPS THIS CHAT STILL HAS TO DRAW — the pure half of
// `PollResponse.inbox` (the project queue, prefs `queue.enabled`).
//
// THE SHAPE OF THE PROBLEM. A line typed into a chat whose turn is already
// running is not queued and is not scheduled: the live host absorbs it, the CLI
// holds it in its own stdin queue, and the model answers it when the current
// turn ends. For that window the message exists in two places — the CLI's queue,
// and this page's optimistic bubble — and only one of them survives a reload.
// The transcript cannot help: nothing has consumed the message, so it is in no
// JSONL row. So a reload (or the standing watch's `refreshHistory`, which
// replaces `turns` wholesale four times a minute) wiped the reader's own words
// off the screen while the CLI sat holding them.
//
// THE RUN HAS THE LIST, SO THE RUN REPORTS IT, and this module is the whole rule
// for reading it: which entries still need a bubble of their own, given what the
// page has already drawn.
//
// THREE WAYS AN ENTRY STOPS NEEDING ONE, and all three are somebody else drawing
// the same message:
//
//   * AN OPTIMISTIC BUBBLE IS ALREADY UP for it. This page posted one the moment
//     the reader pressed Enter (`run-controller`'s `queued` list), and that is
//     the same message — matched by TEXT, because the optimistic row is minted
//     before any id exists and never gains one.
//   * THE TRANSCRIPT HAS GAINED ITS ROW. The model got to it: there is now a
//     real user turn saying exactly this, and a second copy under the log would
//     be the message appearing twice.
//   * IT LEFT THE INBOX. Nothing to decide — the list is the state, and an entry
//     that is no longer in it is no longer waiting.
//
// TEXT IS ONLY EVER MATCHED AGAINST THOSE TWO, AND ONE FOR ONE (🔴 review
// 2026-09-12). The inbox's own rows are deduped by ID, because the host's list is
// a list of MESSAGES and not a set of strings: a reader who sends "go on" twice
// while a turn runs has sent two follow-ups, both are held, and folding them into
// one bubble showed the second one going missing. And a text that IS already
// drawn retires exactly one row, not every row saying it — two "go on"s with one
// optimistic bubble up is one bubble drawn here, not none.
//
// A DRAINED ENTRY DRAWS THE SAME. The server lists follow-ups the host has taken
// but the transcript has not echoed (`InboxMessage.drained`); for the reader that
// is the same fact as an undrained one, and only the echo — a real user turn —
// retires the bubble.
//
// PURE, AND NOTHING BUT A FILTER. It takes what the poll said, what the
// controller is drawing and what the transcript holds, and answers with a
// subset of the first. No React, no fetches, no clock.
