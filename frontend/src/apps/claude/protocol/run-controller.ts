// THE RUN LOOP, ported from `T`'s `sendMessage` / `pollLoop` / `sendFollowUp` /
// `stopRun` / `syncPermissions` / `answerAppState` / `loadHistory`. Pure TS: no
// React, no DOM. The UI reads `ChatState` and calls the methods on
// `ChatController` (protocol/controller-api.ts).
//
// The five rules that make this correct, each of which had its own bug first:
//
// 1. NO CURSOR. Every poll returns the WHOLE turn — segments, text,
//    permissions, skills and app_state all replayed — and the client dedupes by
//    id / renders idempotently (T:16250-16261, segments.ts). The cadence is a
//    flat `sleep(400)` with no backoff (T:16377).
//
// 2. D687 SLICING. The server cursor deliberately refuses to advance past a
//    mid-turn echo, so after a follow-up lands the replay still carries
//    everything already streamed ABOVE it. The loop freezes the PREVIOUS
//    iteration's lengths into `segBase`/`textBase` and slices back to them, so
//    the new bubble shows only the continuation (T:16269-16283).
//
// 3. SEATS. `logGen` (the visible transcript's generation, sampled by the
//    CALLER before its awaits), `sendSeq`, `loopSeq`, `activeSeat`,
//    `stoppedSeat` and `followupSeq`. Only the NEWEST loop may clear the `run`
//    param, drop the Stop chrome or post "Stopped." — equality on a run id is
//    not proof of ownership, because a reopened chat re-attaches to the SAME
//    run id (Bugbot, PR #653: T:16311-16318, 16396-16410).
//
// 4. A THROWN POLL ABORTS THE BUBBLE AND KEEPS `?run=`. The partial reply goes
//    so a failed run never leaves half a sentence behind; the param stays so the
//    next boot re-attaches to the subprocess, which is still working
//    (T:16378-16386).
//
// 5. CARDS LAND BELOW THE PROSE THEY INTERRUPT. `syncPermissions` runs AFTER
//    the segment render, every poll, and re-pins the open cards last
//    (T:16305-16311, 14665-14775).

   *
   * It exists because PR4's two watchers read different clocks: the standing
   * watch looks every 5 s, the schedule poll every 15. A fired scheduled run is

   * go down in `adoptWatch` before `resumeRun` and again at the top of
   * `resumeAttach` before the probe — which made this loop's own stated
   * recovery unreachable: `resumeRun` bailing on the send gate is "a lap of
   * this loop away from trying again", but the next lap hit `shownRuns.has(id)`
   * and skipped the id for the life of the page. A live run passed over because
   * a send happened to be in flight, or whose first probe threw, was then never
   * adopted by the run-dir road at all — only the coarse transcript follower
   * recovered it, with no streaming chrome and whole-turn granularity, and
   * `setRunParam(id)` left a stale `?run=` on the URL. So the two early writes
   * are gone and the mark lands where the run is genuinely ours: past
   * `resumeAttach`'s `unknown run_id` check (every road on from there either
   * streams through `pollLoop` or repairs the turn from the probe payload) and
   * in `pollLoop` itself.
   *
   * CLEARED WHEN THE VISIBLE CONVERSATION IS REPLACED (Bugbot 3974975055).
   * "Never cleared" was wrong for the one gesture PR4 is built around: Back
   * mid-turn leaves the run going server-side and the session list is supposed
   * to re-attach to it — but the id was already in here from `pollLoop`, so
   * `adoptWatch` refused it and the reader got the external "Running outside
   * this app" line with no stop control and no token count. The set answers "is
   * this run's turn already ON SCREEN", and a transcript rebuilt from `history`
   * (or emptied) is precisely the event that makes the answer no. Both roads

   * got it and, on the measured behaviour of the held-open stdin, echoed it

   *
   * `opts` IS THE SEND'S OWN OPTIONS, kept for exactly one reason: the pictures.

     * ONE BUBBLE PER REPLY IN THE PAYLOAD, keyed by SLOT.
     *
     * A poll payload used to be one reply, and this was a single `bubble` plus
     * a `segBase`/`textBase` pair frozen when `followupSeq` moved (D687). The
     * freeze is a GUESS at the seam — "the lengths as of the poll before the
     * send" — and it is wrong by however much of the first reply streamed
     * after the send, because agent.py blanks `text`/`segments` for the whole
     * `pending_echo` window and then hands back the FIRST reply complete on
     * the poll where the echo lands. So the first reply's remainder rendered
     * under the follow-up's own bubble, and the follow-up's real answer sliced
     * to nothing behind it: "the remaining response is cut off and it looks
     * stuck on the queued message" (QA feedback #9), while a reload looked
     * right because `_history` splits on the same echo rows with the whole
     * file to do it with.
     *
     * The seam is now REPORTED, not guessed — `poll.turn_breaks`
     * (`_absorbed_turn_breaks`) — so a payload with N seams is N+1 replies and
     * each gets its own bubble, in payload order, which is the order the
     * follow-up bubbles between them already sit in (`sendFollowUp` appends at
     * the tail). That is the reloaded transcript, live.
     *
     * The SLOT, rather than the payload index, is what survives the cursor
     * moving: `_read_current_turn` advances past a seam once a `result` closed
     * the reply before it, and from that poll on the payload is only the newer
     * reply with no seam in it at all. `chunkOffset` absorbs that (see the
     * shrink test in the loop), so slot 0 stays slot 0's bubble for life.

      //     (T:15911-15919). Whatever it names never reached the model.
      //  2. AN UNCONFIRMED SEND (`!entry.landed`) — the `send` POST was still
      //     in flight when Stop was pressed, so the inbox never acknowledged
      //     it. The interrupt is racing that write and the message may be
      //     dropped either side of it; the honest reading is "it did not
      //     land", and handing it back is recoverable where losing it is not.
      //
      // EVERYTHING ELSE STAYS A BUBBLE. A follow-up fed through the held-open
      // stdin is echoed into `out.jsonl` the moment the inbox drains, so by
      // the time an interrupt lands the CLI no longer counts it as queued and
      // answers `{"still_queued": []}` — which used to be read here as "the
      // CLI told us nothing, so assume everything was stranded" and hand the
      // whole queue back. That is the WRONG WAY ROUND on the common path:
      // Claude had already read the message (Surya's mid-response drain), and
      // yanking it out of the transcript and back into the box denied a turn
      // the reader had watched happen. An empty `still_queued` from a live
      // host is now taken at its word: nothing was queued, so nothing is
      // owed back.

   * IS ANYTHING STILL RUNNING FOR THIS CHAT? (T:17506-17663 `adoptLiveRun`.)
   *
   * A run id lives on the URL, and only there. Opening a conversation from the
   * session list, a folder listing, the cards wall or Peek hands over a
   * `session_id` and nothing else — so a turn that was mid-flight rendered as
   * a finished transcript with no working line, and, the way QA hit it
   * (feedback #25), a tool call blocked on a permission showed "waiting for
   * approval" with NO CARD to answer it, because cards only ever arrive on a
   * poll and nothing was polling.
   *
   * So the session is asked directly. `live_run` matches on the target first
   * and on either of the two ids that can name one chat (the session the run
   * resumed and the one the CLI minted for it — `--fork-session` makes those
   * different), and answers `""` when there is nothing going.
   *
   * PR1's SUBSET, deliberately: this is the WINDOW around opening a chat. The
   * standing watch that adopts a turn started later in the life of the page
   * (T:17553-17663, D415) is PR4.
   *
   * Every guard here is one of T's, and each is a way this can adopt into the
   * wrong transcript:
   *   * `logGen` — the reader went home; nothing on this page is ours.
   *   * `activeRun` — somebody attached already (this call, or the user's own
   *     send). The watch is over, not merely skipped.
   *   * `sending` — the gate is held THIS tick (history still restoring, a send
   *     in flight); look again next lap rather than give up.
   * A failed lookup ends the watch and leaves the transcript exactly as it
   * rendered: a missing working line is a smaller lie than a run adopted onto
   * a conversation this is no longer showing.
