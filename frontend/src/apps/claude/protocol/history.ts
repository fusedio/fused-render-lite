// A restored conversation, and the strings a session row wears.
//
// `T`'s `loadHistory` (T:17988-18060) is half renderer and half protocol; this
// is the protocol half — the payload turned into `Turn[]` — so the React side
// only has to draw. The rules it keeps:
//
//   * a USER turn's display text is `stripBlocks(t.text)`, and the RAW text is
//     kept beside it: the "what was sent" popover rebuilds its receipt out of
//     that wire alone (T:18029, T:10932).
//
//     WHICH BLOCKS ARE STILL ON THAT WIRE IS THE SERVER'S CALL, and it is not
//     all of them. `agent.py`'s `_history` runs `_strip_app_state` over every
//     user row BEFORE the payload is built ("the user never typed it and never
//     saw it"), so `<live-app-state>` cannot reach this function — `stripBlocks`
//     is a no-op for it here and `raw === text` for a turn that pushed app
//     state. `<pane-shot>` and `<annotations>` DO survive, which is exactly why
//     those two receipts rebuild after a reload (`ui/Receipts.tsx`) and the
//     app-state line does not.
//
//     So `appState` is deliberately NOT set here (R1-1, reviewed and rejected
//     2026-09-10): there is no evidence of the block in the payload to read it
//     off, and drawing the line without the wire would be an inert
//     "app state attached" over a panel that can only show the bubble back —
//     the lie `receipt-door.test.tsx` already forbids. Verified against a real
//     transcript with nine app-state sends: `_history` returns none of them.
//     Restoring that receipt needs a flag from the server, which is a Python
//     change and a separate piece of work.
//   * an assistant turn carries `segments` only when it had any; a text-only
//     turn has no such key at all (agent.py:5041, T:18024).
//   * `stopped` is written by agent.py `_stopped_last` on the LAST turn only,
//     and only when true (agent.py:5049) — it renders as the same ⏹ "Stopped."
//     note a live stop leaves, so a conversation reads identically whether you
//     watched the stop or came back to it (T:18040-18048).
//   * `ts` is the transcript record's `timestamp` in epoch SECONDS (agent.py
//     `_row_ts`), on USER rows only — the chat draws it in the left icon lane
//     on hover. Optional on the wire and optional here: an older server, or a
//     row whose stamp does not parse, simply has no time to show, and the key
//     is absent rather than zero (`0` is a real instant, i.e. 1970).
//   * `uuid` is the transcript record's own id — the value the Tasks list
//     carries as a message `anchor`, which is what makes `?msg=` resolvable
//     (T:18030). Optional: a payload without it simply cannot be anchored to.
