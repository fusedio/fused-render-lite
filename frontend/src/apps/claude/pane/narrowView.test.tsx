// The narrow view's TWO writes — the one that goes into history and the one
// that deliberately does not — and the toggle's own chrome.
//
// Bugbot #447's no-history rule was about the RESIZE, and it is easy to
// over-apply: a breakpoint crossing is the layout changing under a reader who
// did nothing, so it must not mint a history entry, while a CLICK on the toggle
// moved the reader and Back should undo it (T:8978 writes `paneview` with no
// override, so the store's once-per-visit push applies). Native gets the resize
// half right in the strictest possible way — `crossView` is a ref and never
// reaches the URL at all — which is exactly why a `{history:"replace"}` on the
// click was invisible: nothing else in the file wanted it.
