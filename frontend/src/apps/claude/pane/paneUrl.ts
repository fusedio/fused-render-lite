// WHAT THE LEFT PANE FRAMES, as a pure decision (T:5219-5470 `paneURL`).
//
// The template did the two fetches (`/api/fs/stat`, `./app.py`) and the decision
// in one async function. Here they are split: the caller fetches (AppPane's
// `usePaneState`), this module decides — so the whole decision tree, including
// the three shapes and the NO-PANE case, is testable with no network and no DOM.
//
// Three shapes and a no-pane case (D235, D239):
//
//   * an APP FOLDER — the app's entry html (its first top-level page carrying
//     `<meta name="fused-app">`, D301, resolved by `./app.py`), noun "project";
//   * a FILE — the file in its OWN default view, exactly what the explorer's
//     preview pane would show it in, with the view SWITCHABLE via `leftmode`;
//   * an ORDINARY FOLDER — NO PANE (D239). `kind: "none"`, not a throw: a
//     folder that is not an app is the ordinary case, and the original throw
//     left a permanent error panel beside a working chat.
//   * CHAT_ONLY — the host owns the pane, so every kind answers `kind: "none"`
//     while still reporting the noun (the placeholders and the system prompt
//     need it either way).
//
// Framed via `/render`, never `/embed`: /embed serves the React shell, which
// nests the target one iframe deeper and puts its document out of the annotation
// layer's reach (T:5248-5258).
