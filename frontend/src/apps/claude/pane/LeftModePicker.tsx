// WHICH VIEW THE LEFT PANE FRAMES — the `leftmode` picker (T:5474-5667).
//
// A trigger and its own listbox popup, quiet to the same degree as the annotate
// switch: borderless, transparent, 12px, muted until hovered. Loud chrome here
// would read as the pane's TITLE rather than as a switch on it, and the pane's
// title is the file name in the topbar.
//
// It WAS a native `<select>`, chosen for the platform popup and the accessible
// name that brings for free. What overturned that is the ICON: an `<option>`
// renders text and nothing else in every engine, so a mode list that shows what
// the shell's own mode menu shows — the template's icon.svg beside its name —
// cannot be built out of one (T:5484-5500). shadcn's `DropdownMenu` (Base UI
// `Menu`) is the native equivalent: real buttons, so focus, Enter, Space, the
// arrow keys, Escape and the outside-click close are all the platform's job
// rather than this file's (design.md §5 maps `#leftmodepop` → DropdownMenu).
//
// THE PICKER WRITES THE PARAM AND NOTHING ELSE (T:5576-5580). `useFramedSrc` in
// AppPane, driven from the same param, is the only thing that touches the
// iframe — one code path for a user click, for a reload with `leftmode` already
// set, and for any later param change.

/**
 * WHERE the picker lives, which is a layout question, not a state one
 * (T:5612-5660).
 *
 *   `"leftbar"`  — the SPLIT layout: a row across the top of the left column.
 *                  The control that chooses what that pane frames, sitting on
 *                  that pane. It spent a while in the shared control strip,
 *                  across the divider, which put a control for one column on the
 *                  other one and left the pane it governs with no chrome at all.
 *   `"anntools"` — the NARROW layout: back into the shared strip. There is no
 *                  persistent left column below the breakpoint (one view shows
 *                  at a time), so there is nothing to hang a bar on, and the
 *                  strip is the one row BOTH views keep on screen. It belongs
 *                  BETWEEN the annotate switch and the view toggle — the toggle
 *                  must stay the row's last word, since it is the way out of the
 *                  preview.
 *   `"none"`     — nothing to pick, or no pane. An APP FOLDER has exactly one
 *                  thing to frame (the entry resolved by app.py, which is not a
 *                  stat entry), an ordinary folder has no pane, and a file with a
 *                  single offerable view has no choice either. A one-item picker
 *                  is chrome that cannot do anything (T:5560-5562).
 *
 * T moved ONE element between the two hosts rather than shipping two copies,
 * because a second control would be a second value and a second listener. Here
 * the value lives in the param and exactly one host renders at a time, so the
 * hazard the move existed to avoid does not arise — but the RULE is the same and
 * lives in one place, which is this function.
