// LIVE APP STATE: what the agent can SEE of the running app (T:4663-5218).
//
// Without this the agent is editing a page it cannot look at: it has no way to
// tell whether its own change rendered, whether the console filled with errors,
// or whether the page went blank. Two channels close that, and both are served
// from one snapshot function:
//
//   push — rides along with each message (`block()` → the `<live-app-state>`
//          block composeOutgoing prepends).
//   pull — the agent's `app_state` MCP tool, answered from the poll loop
//          (useAppStateResponder), for after it edits something and the pushed
//          snapshot has gone stale.
//
// The two disagree on purpose, in three places — see `push`, `pull` and the
// console trim for what about. The push side is a block nobody asked for and
// pays for itself on every later turn; the pull side is an answer to a tool call
// and hands over everything it has.
//
// It is deliberately TEXT ONLY — structure, own-text, params, console lines —
// for the same reason the annotation anchors are (#372): a description Claude
// can map straight back to the app's HTML source beats pixels it has to guess
// from. Nothing here may break the chat: the framed document can be
// mid-navigation, absent, or cross-origin, so every access is guarded and a
// failure degrades to LESS state, never to a thrown send.
//
// SAME-ORIGIN DIRECT ACCESS, never postMessage (D3/D4, T:5247): the pane is
// `/render?path=…` on our own origin, so `frame.contentWindow.document` IS the
// app's document. Every read is inside a try/catch exactly as T's is.

   * It goes in the screenshot directory, the same kind of artifact under the

   * one path `--allowed-tools` lets Read touch without raising a card.
   *
