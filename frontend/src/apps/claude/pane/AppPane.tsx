// ── enterNoPane: a designed ABSENCE, not a missing element ────────────────────
//
// THE HAZARD THIS SHAPE EXISTS TO AVOID (T:5704-5761). The obvious template
// implementation — ship the markup without the frame for this target — could not
// work and failed in a way that hid itself: the frame's `load` hook was wired at
// top level, so with no element to wire that statement threw and aborted every
// declaration after it, and the boot catch could not report it either because
// its first statement was `.remove()` on the same missing element. A blank page
// with a working-looking composer.
//
// React removes the whole class of failure — a component that is not rendered
// wires nothing — so step 6 below is simply "do not render". What does NOT go
// away is the ORDER of the other five, because both of the first two undo
// something BOOT already did on the strength of a param, before anyone knew
// there was no pane. Both were live bugs found by opening a folder URL that
// still carried an old bookmark's `annotations` and `paneview=preview`.
//
// THE ORDER, verbatim (T:5762-5836):
//
//   1. Drop the notes and repaint, WHILE `noPane` is still false so the repaint
//      actually runs. The boot repaint had ALREADY painted a chip per composer
//      from the `annotations` param, and a later `noPane` early-return would
//      have frozen it on screen — a chip showing a note that cannot be sent is a
//      worse lie than no chip. The PARAM is left alone: this drops the list, it
//      does not rewrite the URL.
//   2. Disarm annotate mode THROUGH `annSetMode`, the one door in and out, so
//      the label, `aria-pressed`, the param and the pins stay in agreement. With
//      `noPane` set the call is a plain disarm that writes no param.
//   3. Drop the narrow layout's view class, which boot stamped from `paneview`.
//      It has to GO rather than be left inert: `view-preview` collapses the chat
//      column to its control strip, and with the strip slimmed and no pane to
//      show instead, a narrow host would render a blank page.
//   4. Stamp the no-pane class, which hands the kebab the strip's auto margin —
//      the annotate switch, its usual owner, is about to leave.
//   5. Rescue the note composer BEFORE the column it lives in goes. CHAT_ONLY
//      only: close it FIRST (a reader who clicked the pane in the gap between
//      the stat fetch and this teardown has an open, portaled composer, and
//      yanking a live one across documents would leave it visible at a
//      coordinate that meant something in someone else's viewport), then park it
//      under the control strip.
//   6. Remove the pane's controls — everything that acts on the column being
//      taken away. The KEBAB STAYS: its one item acts on the TARGET, and a
//      folder with no preview is still a thing to open a terminal session on.
//      CHAT_ONLY keeps the annotate switch, the recorder, the pin-kind picker
//      and the screenshot button, because those act on the HOST's pane, which
//      that layout still has.
//
// CHAT_ONLY takes this same path (the decision answers `kind: "none"` for every
// kind there) and it is the one caller for which "no pane of ours" is NOT
// "nothing to annotate" — hence steps 1, 2 and 5's exceptions.
//
// What this deliberately does NOT do is tidy the URL: `split`, `paneview`,
// `leftmode`, `annmode` and `annotations` left by an old bookmark are IGNORED,
// silently — the same forgiving posture PT-9 takes for an unknown `_mode`.
// Deleting them would break the bookmark's round trip for the day that folder
// becomes an app and gets its pane back.
