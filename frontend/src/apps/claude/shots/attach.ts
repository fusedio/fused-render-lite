//
// Four gestures, one pipeline: the camera (`attachPane`), a paste or a drop of
// BYTES (`attachFiles`), a drag from inside fused-render that carried a real
// PATH (`attachPaths`), and the send-time badged overview (`attachOverview`).
// All four land in the shots directory, wear a chip, open the same viewer, ride
// the same `<pane-shot>` block and leave the same receipt — which is the whole
// design: that directory is already the one path `--allowed-tools` pre-approves a
// `Read` of, already pruned (12h/200 files), already served back through
// `/api/fs/raw` for a restored turn.
//
// Nothing here throws for a reason the user could act on. Every refusal becomes
// an attachment carrying its own `why`, so nothing the user gestured at
// disappears without an answer — and since D615 exactly ONE thing still refuses:
// an upload that failed.
