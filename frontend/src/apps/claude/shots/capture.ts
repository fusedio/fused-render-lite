// ONE PICTURE OF THE PANE (T:9958 shotPane, 10088 shotCapturePane, 10127
// annCaptureOverview, 10199 annOverview, 11232 shotFlash).
//
// The order is T's exactly, and it is a preference rather than a gate: NATIVE
// screen shot first (live pixels, no prompt, WebGL included), then the TAB share
// for a cross-origin target that could not be shot that way, then the DOM clone
// for a readable one. Nothing that worked stops working.
//
// Bounded by SHOT_TIMEOUT_MS, and the timer is only HALF of what makes the budget
// real: a `setTimeout` cannot fire while synchronous code runs, so the deadline
// handed DOWN to the style walk is the other half (T:10199). A timed-out capture
// is abandoned, not cancelled — so it is still watched to the end, because it may
// still reject (an unhandled rejection in the console) and may still have minted
// an object URL nobody holds a handle to any more.
