// (D349). What the browser can still hand over is the TAB's own pixels:
// `getDisplayMedia` with `preferCurrentTab`, one frame grabbed off the video
// track and cropped to the marked iframe's rect — the same box the overlay (and
// so every point coordinate) lives in, so the crops and the whole-pane shot line
// up with the pins for free.
//
// The stream is KEPT between captures: the share prompt is paid once, not once
// per note — a walkthrough clicking ten spots must not raise ten pickers.
// Released when the user ends the share (`ended`), when the target stops being
// cross-origin, and on pagehide.

 * the gap. What has ended is this mount's USE for the share, not the mount.
