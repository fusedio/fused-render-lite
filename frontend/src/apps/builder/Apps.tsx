// breadcrumb). Every detected app in the workspace (GET /api/apps) as a grid
// of big preview cards — each thumbnail is the app itself rendered in a
// scaled, non-interactive iframe (AppPreviewCard). The list is narrowed by a
// filter row — a Category/Folders mode selector with chips derived from the
// apps themselves (categories from each folder's metadata.json, ordered
// curated-first then locale-alphabetical by app-categories; folders from the
// top-level tag dirs, plain code-unit sort) — and a search box
// (name/title/tag/category, case-insensitive); the selector sits at the row's
// left edge with the chips and search gathered at the right.
// Order is always recently-opened (modified time stands in
// for an app never opened — appEntry.sortApps); filtering never reorders cards
// relative to each other.
