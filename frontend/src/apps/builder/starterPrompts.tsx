  // **`kind` appears in exactly ONE of these five briefs, and that is the whole

  // (SPEC §40): it was trained with a question marked differently from a
  // passage, and using one side for both costs real recall — silently, since the
  // vectors still come back unit length and comparable. So an ASYMMETRIC app —
  // one that indexes a corpus and then searches it with something that is not
  // itself a corpus entry — has to pass `kind`, and "Semantic search" is the
  // only one of these that is shaped that way.
  //
  // The other three text briefs are SYMMETRIC by construction: "Related notes"
  // compares notes to notes, "Bookmark clusters" clusters bookmarks against each
  // other, "Duplicate finder" scores pairs of the same kind of thing. There both
  // sides ARE the same kind, so the uniform default (`"document"`) is correct and
  // splitting them would be the bug rather than the fix. Do not add `kind` to
  // them for symmetry with the one above.
  //
  // "Photo search" needs neither: it names a multimodal model from `catalog()`,
  // and a dual encoder has no retrieval convention at all — the route refuses
  // `kind` on one.
