// The Claude config panel: a native React port of the bundled html+py app that
// used to sit here in an iframe (D125), built out of the shell's own primitives
// so it follows the Light/Dark setting and shares one toast/modal surface with
// the rest of the app instead of shipping a second, Claude-branded one.
//
// The layout is NOT the original app's any more. That app owned the whole
// window and could afford a 230px section nav down the left; inside this shell
// that nav landed directly beside the global sidebar and the page read as two
// sidebars glued together. So the sections are a horizontal TAB STRIP across
// the top, and the horizontal budget the nav was eating goes to the content:
//
//   ┌ cc-header ───────────────────────────────────────────── 49px ┐
//   │ Claude config                          [● Clean / N uncommitted]│
//   ├ cc-tabbar ──────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
//   │ Plugins  Memory  Skills  Statusline  MCP  Preferences         │
//   ├ cc-body ──────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
//   │ caption (the file this tab edits)                            │
//   │ section content                                               │
//   └───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
//
// Two pieces of state, each in the place that suits it:
//
//   * the active SECTION lives in the URL (`?cctab=plugins`) — bookmarkable, and
//     the same navigateUrl pattern the shell's own tab strips use;
//   * the git epoch lives here, because every section can dirty the repo and
//     they all report back through one `onChanged`.
//
// History is deliberately NOT one of the tabs. It is the git chip in the
// header band, because it is the only page whose state matters while you are
// looking at some other one: the chip carries the dirty state that tells you
// the config has uncommitted drift (a tab-strip button used to carry that as
// a dot, and its own edge-pinned position was what clipped the strip's last
// tab label at a narrow width — the header has no such neighbour to collide
// with), and it is where you commit that drift. Profiles lives on it too — a
// profile is a git branch over the same repo, so it belongs with the history
// rather than beside Preferences.
//
// The CLAUDE.md explorer ("MD Files") is GONE (round 2): it was a browse-and-
// preview surface bolted onto a page whose job is configuring things, and it
// was the only section that needed a second body column. `?cctab=claudemd`
// and the legacy `/claude-md` URL both redirect to the panel's default tab
// now (shell/App.tsx).
//
// A note on remounting: the shell renders this page keyed on the nav epoch, so
// any navigation — including this panel's own `?cctab=` writes — remounts it.
// That is why nothing here tries to cache across a section change: a section
// switch IS a fresh mount, and each section refetches exactly as the original
// app re-rendered.
