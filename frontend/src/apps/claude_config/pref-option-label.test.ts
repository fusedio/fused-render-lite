// optionLabel / storedOptionLabel: how a catalog OPTION is said, on the select
// itself and for a value read back off disk. See the functions' own comments
// in PreferencesSection.tsx for the "why" — this locks the one case that used
// to read wrong: a model id wearing the CLI's `[1m]` context qualifier
// (`fable[1m]`) used to fall all the way to "(not in catalog)"
// because the catalog only lists the BARE id, never the qualifier permutation.
