// The shell's composer for the status bar's Activity chip. This is the ONE
// place `<DownloadManager>` is instantiated, and it is the sole reason
// `shell/QueueDock.tsx` and `shell/EnginesDock.tsx` — two separate composers,
// one per chip that used to exist — are gone. `DownloadManager`
// (platform/ui/DownloadManager.tsx) draws the Running section (job rows) and
// the Background tasks section (running engines). Its header comment has the
// panel layout; this file only owns getting the two DATA SOURCES to it.
// (Models — resident AI models — made this same trip during the merge and
// then split back out into its own chip, `shell/ModelsDock.tsx`, once its own
// filled/outlined dot needed to answer a question this chip's shared "is
// there work right now" dot could not.)
//
// A SCHEDULED MESSAGE'S OWN RUN DRAWS NO ROW HERE AT ALL (D661, user: "a task
// is not something I even want in the activity. that was added
// unintentionally"). This file used to poll `/api/schedule-queue` itself and
// hand `DownloadManager` a `queue` slot of scheduled-message rows merged in
// beside the job rows — that whole poll, `useQueue`, `QueueRowView`, and
// `shell/queue-dock-lib.ts` (its pure row-shaping half) are DELETED, not
// merely unused. `jobs.ts`'s `jobRows` now excludes `sys:schedule:*` jobs
// unconditionally (no more "exempt only while queued" carve-out), so a
// scheduled run cannot draw a row here no matter what state it is in. A run
// that was missed or failed still gets a toast (`toastForEvent`,
// platform/lib/schedule-toast.ts, consuming `useScheduleEvents` in App.tsx);
// a successful run gets none — `toastForEvent` returns null for
// `kind === "done"` — so its only surface is the Scheduled/Tasks page.
// `fused_render/schedule.py`'s own `_emit`/`_report` are untouched, since its
// poll loop still reads its own report back to notice a live cancel request.
//
// A KNOWN LOSS FROM THIS (documented prominently in DECISIONS.md): the old
// queue card could cancel an ALREADY-RUNNING scheduled turn (`cancelJob` on
// its `sys:schedule:` job id) — `shell/Scheduled.tsx` only cancels an
// entry that has not been sent yet. There is currently no surface for
// stopping a turn already in flight. Accepted rather than worked around: the
// user's own words were that this row should not exist at all, and rebuilding
// a narrower "cancel only" control just to keep that one capability would be
// reintroducing the exact row they asked to have removed.
//
// WHY THE ENGINE SOURCE STAYS HERE, NOT IN PLATFORM — the same boundary
// argument StatusBar.tsx has always made for RepoUpdatesDock/ModelsDock:
// `DownloadManager`'s job is to RENDER rows from data, not to fetch it, and
// this component is the shell's one place that fetches for it.
