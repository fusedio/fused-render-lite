// The board has been round this loop twice. The lane painted a fill at rest, so an
// empty lane was a grey slab and every card competed with the box around it (Akshil,
// 2026-08-17, against flow side by side); the fill came off and a `--border` hairline
// went on in its place, because unfilled and unbounded a column had no edge at all.
// On 2026-08-18 the hairline turned out to be the same mistake in thinner form —
// five outlined boxes read as five boxes — and both were replaced by the thing that
// was actually wanted: an ORDERING. The lane is a fill that LOSES to the card, the
// card is the only surface that steps toward the reader, and the collapsed rail
// keeps its hairline because it is a control rather than a column.
//
// So what is read out of the stylesheets is the ordering itself (page < lane < card
// in dark, card above lane in light — asserted on the token VALUES, since a
// relationship written only in prose is one a later tuning can silently invert), the
// open lane's lack of an edge against the rail's, the card's lift in both themes,
// and the drop states, which have to keep announcing themselves by ADDING paint on a
// box that now has a resting fill again.
