// The status bar's Models section (D565): the PERSISTENT half — what is
// resident in memory right now, and what it costs — its own chip again after
// a brief detour: the status-bar merge (commit 33fc407d) folded this into the
// combined "Activity" chip alongside Jobs and Engines, but the user relies on
// this chip's own filled/outlined dot to know whether the machine is holding
// any model weights at all, and that signal got diluted once the dot also had
// to answer for jobs and engines. This file is Models' chip again, left of
// Activity and Notifications (StatusBar.tsx's own header comment has the
// full lifetime-ordering principle: Models is persistent status, Jobs/
// Notifications are transient work that appears and resolves).
//
// A QUICK-INFO POPOVER, NOT A MANAGEMENT CONSOLE (user call, revising an
// earlier gauge/progress-bar draft: "we don't need a gauge if too
// complicated. just a quick info upon clicking which we have a list of
// loaded models we can unload"). The chip is the label `Models` plus ONE
// circle, outlined when nothing is resident and filled when something is
// (D588/D590, user: "no count. just a circle outlined or filled") — it carried
// a count until D588 and a total cost until D589, and carries neither now. The
// panel is one row per resident model: its name, what it is holding, and an
// Unload button. No gauge, no proportional fill, no RAM fraction — that is the
// whole feature.
//
// NO NEW TRANSPORT: `useAiRuntime` (apps/ai_models/lib/aiRuntime.ts) already
// polls `GET /api/ai/runtime` — the same shared poll GlobalSidebar's own
// resident-model dot reads, so this section costs no second request, and its
// own docstring already sanctions polling it ("so the sidebar can poll it").
// `unloadAiModel` (platform/lib/api.ts) already wraps `POST
// /api/ai/runtime/unload` with the D3 `X-Fused` guard every other mutation in
// the app carries.
//
// WHY THIS FILE LIVES IN shell/, NOT platform/ — the same reason
// QueueDock.tsx/RepoUpdatesDock.tsx do: `aiRuntime.ts` is apps/ai_models
// territory, and platform may not import apps (frontend/scripts/
// check-boundaries.mjs); shell may import anything, so the shell composes
// this section and hands it to `StatusBar` as `models`, same as before the
// merge.
//
// `ModelRow` draws through `platform/ui/NotificationCard.tsx`, the row shape
// every status-bar panel shares (Models, Engines, Jobs, repo updates,
// waiting tasks, LAN pairings). `MemoryCell`/`memoryBand` stay local to this
// file — they are the row's `figures` content, not part of the shared shape
// — and this file otherwise only needs `AiLoadedModel` (platform/lib/api, a
// type) and `unloadAiModel` (platform/lib/api, a call); nothing shell-only
// leaks into platform (`check-boundaries.mjs` enforces `platform` never
// importing `shell`, which is why the shared card lives under `platform/ui/`
// and this file imports it, not the other way around).
//
// SPLIT INTO A PURE VIEW (`ModelsCardView`) AND A STATEFUL WRAPPER
// (`ModelsDock`, default export) — the same split DownloadManagerView/
// RepoUpdatesCardView use, for the identical reason: no polling, no network,
// no `window`/`document`, so ModelsDock.test.tsx can render the view
// directly with a fixed model list rather than mocking `useAiRuntime`.

// written and never read is worse than no key, because the next reader assumes
// it means something.
//
// WHY: a `.dl-panel` floats above the page and is dismissed by an outside
// pointer-down or Escape. That is popover behaviour, and a popover that
// restores itself across reloads covers the page on every navigation. "Open"
// is a statement about this moment, not a preference worth remembering.
//
// The transient `autoOpen`/`autoClose` overrides are untouched; opening is an
// explicit click within the session.

// Drawn through `NotificationCard` (`liveAction` for Unload, `figures` for
// the memory readout) — a model row is shaped exactly like a job row (a
// name, a number, an action, an optional status line under it), and the
// shared card already draws that shape correctly in both themes.
// `.dl-row-cancel` is Unload's, the same "text, not a ✕" control JobRow's
// own Cancel wears — Unload is a distinct verb from Cancel, but the same
// visual language: a row-scoped, quietly-styled text button, not a glyph.
/** THE ROW'S MEMORY FIGURES. Both are INSTANTANEOUS now, and one is a genuine
 *  subset of the other, which is what makes the pair readable at all (D600 —
 *  the user's own pick from three spelled-out options): `1.8 GB now (24 GB
 *  held)`.
 *
 *  `residentBytes` LEADS and the held figure is parenthetical, the reverse
 *  of D594/D597 where the primary was the measured COST. Pairing a durable
 *  cost with a live reading put two numbers on different time axes side by
 *  side, and on MLX they disagreed by ~11 GB for no visible reason (13 GB cost
 *  against 24 GB held). Both figures here are "right now", which is what makes
 *  the pair readable at all.
 *
 *  THE HELD FIGURE IS `max(residentBytes, osFootprintBytes)`, NOT
 *  `osFootprintBytes`: it is not a subset in either direction. `phys_footprint`
 *  excludes clean file-backed pages and `resident_size` counts them, so a
 *  runner that maps its weights read-only — GGUF/llama.cpp, torch with
 *  `mmap=True` — has the SMALLER footprint of the two, by roughly the size of
 *  the model file. `max` is a strictly better LOWER BOUND than either, and the
 *  only cheap value that keeps the invariant this pair depends on — "held" is
 *  never less than "now".
 *
 *  THE PARENTHETICAL IS OMITTED WHEN THE TWO ARE EQUAL, which the max makes a
 *  common case rather than a rarity. `1.2 GB now (1.2 GB held)` carries no
 *  information and invites the reader to hunt for a difference that is not
 *  there; the bare `1.2 GB now` says the same thing.
 *
 *  THE MEASURED COST IS NOT GONE — it moved into the hover `title` with its
 *  basis. The field stays in the payload because `fit.py` and the AI Models
 *  page both read it; it simply stopped competing for the row's one visible
 *  slot.
 *
 *  LABELLED IN WORDS (`now` / `held`): two byte figures side by side are
 *  otherwise indistinguishable, and the entire point of this pairing is that
 *  they answer different questions.

 *  while the AI Models page's fit badge bands what the model COST to run
 *  (`footprintBytes`, off `fit.py`'s ladder). On MLX those differ by ~11 GB by
 *  measurement (13 GB cost against 24 GB held, D601).
 *
 *  THAT DIVERGENCE IS THE POINT: the badge answers "can I run this here", a
 *  durable claim about a model; the bar answers "what is this costing me
 *  right now", which has to move as the worker allocates. Sharing the
 *  THRESHOLDS is what keeps them comparable — the same utilization means the
 *  same colour — and forcing them to share an INPUT would make one of the two
 *  lie.
 *
 *  The thresholds are utilization of the ceiling, and `no` means the figure
