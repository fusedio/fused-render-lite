// §5 (SPEC-quiet-notifications.md) "interactive turns and needs-input" — the
// decision table, split from the hook that drives it (useTaskStatusNotify.ts)
// the same way schedule-toast.ts/scheduleEvents.ts split rules from polling —
// so the rules can be tested without a DOM.
//
// Derives from the EXISTING task-status poll (tasksPulse.ts's
// useTasksPulseRows) rather than adding a server channel, per the spec's own
// "Sources" instruction — `/api/tasks`+`/api/tasks/changes`
// (fused_render/server/routers/tasks.py `_status()`) already computes
// `needs_attention` as its rule 0 and `in_progress`/`blocked`/`done` for
// everything else. This file only watches for the three transitions the
// spec's table names:
//   - in_progress -> done            ("Task finished")
//   - in_progress -> blocked         ("Task failed")
//   - anything    -> needs_attention ("Task needs your input")
//
// NEEDS_ATTENTION IS ALREADY RETAINED (Akshil, 2026-09-03; tasks-lib.ts's
// `attentionRows`, wired into RepoUpdatesDock.tsx line ~1185) — a dedicated,
// always-current Notifications-panel row for every task parked on a
// question, with its own dismiss/undismiss lifecycle (RepoUpdatesDock.test.tsx,
// "the waiting-task row"). Routing this transition through notify()'s
// ordinary `tone: "error"` shape would ALWAYS-retain (notifications.ts's
// `isRetained`) a SECOND, separately-dismissible row for the exact same
// fact — a visible duplicate, not a second source of truth. So this one
// transition raises a plain notify() with no tone/tier (resolves to
// "transient": pops, does NOT retain, per notifications.ts's `resolveTier`/
// `isRetained`) — the one thing `attentionRows` cannot do on its own, an
// announcement at the MOMENT a task parks. `attentionRows` keeps covering
// "is still parked" for as long as that remains true.
//
// `in_progress -> blocked` ("Task failed") has no pre-existing row anywhere
// in the Notifications panel, so it keeps the ordinary `tone: "error"` shape
// (pop + retain, with a `page` so the row is clickable, per
// SPEC-actionable-notifications.md's "every row goes somewhere").
//
// `in_progress -> done` ("Task finished") IS RETAINED AND CLICKABLE — a
// REVERSAL of this file's own earlier position (until 2026-09-16 this
// comment argued a plain "it's over" confirmation "is not something to hunt
// for again" and the branch below returned no `page` at all, which
// `lib/notifications.ts`'s `isRetained` resolves to a transient popup that
// is never kept). The user, from a screenshot: "the user does want to open
// the app along with claude template to go back" — a finished run is
// exactly the moment someone wants to jump back into it, so losing the row
// the instant the popup's ~2.5s expire was the bug, not a feature. `page:
// taskDestination(task)` gives it the same destination
// `in_progress -> blocked` already carries, which alone makes
// `isRetained` keep it (`Boolean(input.action || input.page)`).
//
// NEVER PRESENCE-SUPPRESSED (2026-09-17, second reversal): this branch used
// to also carry `source: taskSource(task)`, which let a finished task's
// POPUP get swallowed by a presence check (jobs.ts, since removed) whenever
// the run's own chat/project was already on screen — "you're already looking at it" for a
// job that is still running. A finished Claude task is different: the run
// has ENDED, so "already looking at the chat" no longer means "already knows
// it's done" the way it does for an in-progress job's own page. Dropping
// `source` here means a finished task always pops, same as `in_progress ->
// blocked` already does. This also drops the `recent: true` flag from the
// now-removed "Recent" section (SPEC-quiet-notifications.md §4, reversed the
// same day — see DECISIONS-quiet-notifications.md): the row simply lands as
// an ordinary retained row in the one unified list.

// test src/shell/task-status-notify.test.ts` run, confirmed by running it

 * is not news BY DEFAULT — `attentionRows` (and the Tasks page itself)
 * already show it, and treating a page load as a wave of transitions would
 * flood a fresh tab with popups for every row already on screen. But a run
 * that STARTS and FINISHES between two polls is ALSO a first sighting of its
 * key (the pulse is keyed on `session_id`, one row per run — see
 * SPEC-quiet-notifications.md's tasksPulse.ts note), and treating every first
 * sighting as silent is exactly why "a finished task usually raises no
 * notification at all" was reported as a bug: the 10s/30s poll routinely
 * never sees a short run `in_progress` at all.
 *
 * `watchStartS` (unix seconds — same unit as `happened_at`) is the moment
 * THIS document started watching, fixed once by the caller (the hook) at its
 * own first tick. It is the only fact that can tell "backfill" (happened
 * before I started looking) from "news" (happened after): a key arriving
 * already in a TERMINAL column (`done`/`blocked`) whose own `happened_at` —
 * "the newest thing that actually happened" on the row, tasks.py's own
 * phrase, never a future due time — is AFTER `watchStartS` counts as that
 * terminal transition, exactly as if this document had caught it mid-flight.
 * A terminal row whose `happened_at` predates `watchStartS` is backfill and
 * stays silent, which is also what makes a document's own first tick quiet
 * by construction: the hook sets `watchStartS` to "now" at that very tick, so
 * nothing already on the very first answer can have a LATER `happened_at`.
 *
 * `needs_attention` is deliberately NOT covered by this backfill/news split —
 * only `done`/`blocked` are, per the spec's own table. A task already parked
 * on a question at first sighting stays silent here regardless of timing;
