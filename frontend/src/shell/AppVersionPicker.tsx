// The app page's version picker: "Live" or a recent commit for the app
// folder, in the header beside the tab strip. Selecting one writes
// `SNAPSHOT_PARAM` (`_snapshot`) onto the page's own URL — the shell's
// existing whole-page snapshot param, carried across every tab hop for free
// (appPageUrl's own `search` carry, no second carry rule needed here) — and
// "Live" clears it.
//
// Rows read `v1`, `v2`, ... rather than a sha — the app page is for basic
// users (DECISIONS-app-snapshot-preview.md). `v<n>` is PURE client-side index
// arithmetic over the list this component already holds: the newest fetched
// commit is `v<total>` (the server's own count of ALL commits touching the
// app folder, not just what fit under the fetch's limit — see
// `GET /api/git/commits`'s own docstring), and each row after it counts down
// by one. The label is presentation only: `_snapshot` on the URL, and every
// `<option>`'s own `value`, stays the commit's hex sha — a v-number
// renumbers on a rebase or branch switch, so a link keyed on one would
// silently come to mean a different commit later. The short sha stays
// reachable as each row's own `title`.
//
// Offered ONLY when `GET /api/git/app-folder` confirms an app folder actually
// encloses `dir`: the same fail-closed probe templates/git/template.html's own
// preview eye uses (D742 / review finding B4), so this control never appears
// somewhere `/api/git/snapshot` could never resolve for, regardless of which
// commit gets picked. Starts hidden (`probe === "checking"`) rather than
// optimistically shown, for the same fail-closed reason.
//
// Deliberately dumb about what a selection MEANS: this component only reads
// and writes the `_snapshot` sha. Resolving that sha into an extracted
// dir/entry/app_dir — what actually redraws Overview/Files/API — is AppPage's
// own job, kept in AppPage's OWN state and rewritten against ITS OWN
// resolution, never a shared module singleton (code review finding 1, round
// 2, on this branch's earlier snapshot work: two apps in one repo share shas,
// and a singleton written by whichever view resolves last can hold another
// view's resolution by the time a caller reads it).
