// The Tasks page's Calendar view — the same unit the List and the Board show (a
// TASK), on a time axis.
//
// The rule the whole file is built on, and the one thing to understand before
// changing anything here:
//
//   ONE CHIP PER TASK PER DAY, anchored at that task's EARLIEST message that
//   day. Later messages the same day nest INSIDE it and the anchor carries the
//   count. An hourly rule is therefore one chip with `+23`, not 24 chips.
//
// All three views show tasks; the calendar is the one with a time axis, so the
// axis decides PLACEMENT — it does not get to change the unit. The accepted cost
// is that a task's 7pm run has no chip at 7pm; the `+N` badge names it and the
// popover lists it with its real time, which is why the popover is not an
// afterthought here. The rejected alternative (a chip per message) shows one
// task many times in a single day, which the other two views never do.
//
// Chips are a FIXED one line tall. A message has a start time and no duration,
// so there is nothing for a variable height to encode — the same reason Google
// Calendar draws a short event as one line. Do not size chips by duration.
//
// Colour is per PROJECT, hashed from the task's folder (schedule-lib.taskColour):
// five days of a daily task read as one thing across the grid, AND every task out
// of one repo carries that repo's hue (Akshil, 2026-08-17).
//
// AN ARCHIVED TASK DRAWS NOTHING. The grid is for what is going to happen and
// what did; a task that was cancelled or skipped outright is filed away, and
// three chips at one time with two of them struck through read as noise (Akshil,
// 2026-08-17). It is the TASK's status that decides, never a run's — a live task
// with one skipped occurrence still draws its chip, and the skip is an Archive
// row inside the popover. taskChips is where the rule lives.
//
// A RULE'S SHAPE IS DRAWN IN BOTH DIRECTIONS. Future occurrences come from the
// server's projection; the slots a PAST-anchored rule went by come from a walk
// the client does itself, because the server has no reason to compute runs it
// will never create. Only the most recent of those past slots is real (catch-up
// materializes exactly one, at that slot's own time) and the ghost over it is
// deduped away; the rest are outlined, greyed and faded, and say Archive.
// Nothing here asks for them to exist — they are drawn, never created.
//
// Two ranges: the week, and Google's "4 days" — today leftmost, arrows stepping
// four days, Today snapping back. The 4-day range earns its place on width, so
// its chips get a larger label, and it is what the calendar OPENS on: four
// readable columns starting at today beat seven cramped ones starting at a
// Monday that may be behind you. Which range is up is remembered, so that
// default only ever applies to a reader who has not chosen — see RANGE_KEY.
//
// QUEUED work — past due and waiting to be claimed — has no strip across the top
// of the grid. It is a MESSAGE, its siblings are already listed in the task's
// popover thread, and a band across the week said otherwise (Akshil,
// 2026-08-17). The queue's two states ride the thread row they belong to, and so
// does the cancel: cancelling races the claim, so an entry the server has
// already handed to the sender comes back REFUSED — and is said so, never
// silently dropped. Missed occurrences are NOT in the queue: they stay greyed on
// their original past slot so history stays readable.
//
// ONE STATUS VOCABULARY. The popover's pill and every thread row say the app's
// words — Upcoming / In Progress / Needs attention / Blocked / Done / Archive —
// and nothing
// else. Failure is a WORD, not just a red ring (Akshil, 2026-08-17); the red
// stays as reinforcement. The two settled edge cases: a skipped occurrence reads
// Archive (filed away, never attempted), and a projected run reads Upcoming with
// a dashed ring, because a projection genuinely is upcoming and the outline is
// what says nothing has been written down yet. The mapping is not this file's
// (that would be a second answer to a question tasks-lib already answers): the
// column comes from tasks-lib.messageTone, the wording from
// schedule-lib.runStatus.
//
// AND THE PILL AND THE ROWS ARE SCOPED DIFFERENTLY ON PURPOSE. The pill is the
// TASK's status (tasks-lib.taskColumn, via schedule-lib.taskStatus) because it
// sits beside TASK-023 in the header and a chip IS a task — the same noun the
// List and the Board show, so the same word. Each ROW is its own run's status.
// The pill used to be the day's WORST run, which is how it came to read "Failed"
// beside a "Run now" button on a rule whose task was merely upcoming; the memo
// that fixed it carries the argument. Day-level facts still reach the eye
// through pixels — the chip's wash (schedule-lib.dayTone) and the dashed ring on
// a projected row — never through a second, contradicting word.
//
// RUN NOW / RE-RUN IS IN THE POPOVER FOOTER, and it is the List's button rather
// than a second one: tasks-lib.taskRunIntent decides whether it appears, which
// message it fires, which of the two calls that is, and which of the two words it
// says. All three views therefore agree by construction (Akshil, 2026-08-17:
// "let's have it in all views why just list view? for future and failed
// events"). The popover CLOSES on a clean run and stays only to show a sentence —
// see runTask, where the reasoning is, because the panel is anchored to a chip
// that the run itself changes.
//
// CHIPS ARE PLACED BY `at`, which is always the time the message was SCHEDULED
// for. `ran_at` is when it went. A task due Monday and caught up on Wednesday
// stays in Monday's column and the popover row says "ran 2 days late" — moving
// the chip would make the grid disagree with the schedule the user wrote.
//
// The layout maths is all in schedule-lib.ts and tested there; this file adds
// pixels and nothing else.
