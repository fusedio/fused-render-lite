// Tasks page — every task on this machine, in one place, three ways.
//
// A TASK IS A CLAUDE SESSION. Same thing, one name. A task owns a THREAD, and
// the thread's MESSAGES are every prompt sent into it — typed in a chat, typed
// in the template's chat, or fired by the scheduler. The three sources differ
// only in how the message arrived; the thread does not care. That is the whole
// model, and it is why this page no longer merges two feeds client-side the way
// it used to: `GET /api/tasks` returns the merge, already titled, already
// counted, already ordered. See
// SPEC.md's SCH section and DECISIONS.md D322.
//
// List and Board show tasks. So does the Calendar — the chip IS a task, not a
// message. What the time axis adds is placement, not a different unit: one chip
// per task per day, anchored at that task's earliest message that day, the rest
// nested behind a `+N`. All three views therefore answer the same question with
// the same noun, which is the point.
//
// Their markup lives in shell/ScheduleTaskViews.tsx (List and Board) and
// shell/ScheduleCalendar.tsx; this file owns the page: the poll, the toggle,
// the filters, the modal.
//
// Scheduling happens in two places, deliberately: the chat composer's Send now
// pill (templates/claude/template.html) when a chat is already open — it knows
// the folder and holds the message — and this page's New task modal when the
// starting point is the calendar ("what should run Monday 9am?"), where no chat
// exists yet to borrow from. A calendar slot click opens the modal with that
// time filled in.
//
// The composer also has a THIRD affordance that lands here: its Schedule button
// links to `/tasks?new=1&target=…`, for the case the pill cannot serve — a
// task that wants a title, a description or a repeat rule. It is a handoff, not
// a second form: the chat sends the folder it is bound to and nothing else, and
// the effect below opens the modal on it.
//
// Backend: fused_render/schedule.py (the store and the loop that fires it),
// fused_render/tasks_store.py + server/routers/tasks.py (task identity, titles,
// unread), server/routers/schedule.py (this page's calls). The app does the
// sending itself rather than handing the job to cron, so a scheduled turn runs
// with the same environment, credentials and file-access consent as one the
// user typed — see that module's docstring for why that matters more than it
// sounds.
//
// The honest cost of that choice is the one thing this page must never hide:
// **nothing fires while the app is closed.** Work that came due meanwhile is
// not lost — it QUEUES and runs when the app next opens. The queue lives in the
// dock, bottom right, which shows what is running and what is past due and
// waiting, and is where either can be cancelled before it goes. It deliberately
// does NOT show work scheduled for later: "queued" means about to run, and a
// list that also held next Tuesday would answer a different question.
//
// Section layout and per-action busy/error state follow shell/Mounts.tsx.

 * the card already knows how to mount on (`DraftSeed`, the shape a reopened
 * task draft uses). One seeding rule for both kinds of draft, which is what
 * makes "the modal opens on the record" a true sentence rather than two
 * near-identical paths.
 *
 * THE WORDS COME OUT OF `text`, SPLIT, and they go back into `text`, JOINED
 * (contract §1: the words live in `text`, never in `form.description`; the
 * modal splits and joins with `splitDraft`/`joinDraft`). So the composer's box
 * and the card's two prose fields are two views of one string, and a hop out
 * followed by Back to chat is lossless. Nothing here reads `form.title` — the
 * title IS the first line, which is also what the listing row prints.
 *
 * `session_id` is the KEY when the key is a session: a hop out of a chat that
 * has already run is a message into that thread, and that is what the Schedule
 * payload's `sessionId` is built from. `new:<file>` has no thread to continue,
 * and its `<file>` is the folder the card falls back to when the record names
 * no target of its own.
 *
 * `at` IS WHAT A SESSION KEY CANNOT SAY (Akshil, 2026-09-16). A `new:<file>` key
 * spells its folder; a session id spells only the thread, so this used to fall
 * through to `""` and the card opened on the reader's HOME — and its first
 * autosave then wrote that home path onto the conversation's own record as the
 * target. Every door that knows the folder now states it: the hop's `?target=`
 * (the composer's own `file`), or a draft row's `project`. The stored form still

   *
   * IT IS THE HOP DOOR, not a second way in — and now that is literally true:
   * a session-bound form IS the session's chat record (contract §1, "one record,
   * two doors"), so this opens the card on `chat[<session>]` through exactly the
   * function the Schedule hop seeds from. One lookup, one seeding rule, one
   * card, and no second draft to reconcile with the first.
   *
   * Same generation guard as every other opening that fetches first, and the
   * same fallthrough: a lookup that fails opens the card anyway rather than
   * dying under the cursor.

   * rather than off a row, because the listing has not answered on first render
   * and this opening must not wait for 800 rows to decide which card to be.

   * A lookup that fails opens the card on the id anyway: the server folds a
   * write naming an existing id into that draft (`drafts.py put_task`), so an

   * Same generation as every other door that fetches first, so a second press
