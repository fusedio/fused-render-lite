// The Fused account — sign in and out of the `fused login` provider that
// Canvases and Share both run on (fused_render/canvases.py owns the routes).
//
// Until this existed the only sign-in/out UI was the Canvases page, which sits
// behind the canvases feature flag (D427): with the flag off there was no way
// to see which account this machine was on, and none to leave it. Share now
// needs the same login for every app, so the account has its own tab here
// rather than living inside one feature's page.
//
// Shaped on Preferences' HuggingFaceSection: no token passes through this
// component in either direction. The button starts the CLI's browser login
// (`_fused_login.py`), the credentials land in `~/.fused/credentials`, and
// this page only ever reads "signed in / as whom". It POLLS while a login is
// in flight — the wait is a person finishing a browser round-trip — and is
// otherwise idle; the shell's sidebar hears every status this page learns
// through `publishLoggedIn`, so its Canvases row flips with the button.
//
// Log out also stops canvas sync (the server pauses every watcher for the
// CLI call and stops them once the logout has succeeded) — said in the
// confirmation-free copy below because it is the one consequence a reader
// would not expect from an account page.
