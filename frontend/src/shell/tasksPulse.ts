// What the sidebar's Tasks entry knows about the Tasks page, shared by the two
// readers of it: the entry itself (GlobalSidebar) and the page (Scheduled).
//
// ONE POLL, TWO READERS — the shape aiRuntime.ts established for the AI Models
// dot, for the same reason. The sidebar needs two numbers and the page needs
// every row; polling twice would ask the same endpoint twice a minute for one
// answer, and worse, the two would disagree for a beat after anything changed.
// So the poll lives here, the sidebar subscribes, and the PAGE publishes what
// its own poll returned (publishTasks) — which resets the timer below, so while
// the page is open this module never calls the server at all.
//
// The cadence follows the state, not the clock: while something is running the
// dot's colour can change on any tick, and while nothing is running the only
// thing that can move is a completion nobody is waiting on this second. An idle
// machine costs one compact `GET /api/tasks/pulse` every 30 seconds. Only the
// Tasks page itself asks for titles, paths, descriptions, and message previews.
//
// WHAT IS NOT HERE: the route. "The reader has landed on /tasks" is the
// sidebar's fact, not this module's — it calls markTasksSeen() — because a store
// that reads location.pathname is a store that has to be told when the pathname
// changes.
//
// AND THE FULL LISTING TOO, since 2026-09-15 — see "THE LISTING FEED" at the
// foot of this file. Same argument one width over: every surface that wants
// `/api/tasks` rows live was opening its own long-poll, and a wall of twelve
// chat cards opened twelve.
