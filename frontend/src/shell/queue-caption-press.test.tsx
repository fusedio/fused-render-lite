// WHAT A QUEUED ROW DRAWS — and, since 2026-09-21, what it does NOT.
//
// THE ROW PRINTS NO PLACE (Akshil, 2026-09-21). "after TASK-046 | 3rd" used to
// sit at the right end of every waiting row and card; the dashed ring and the
// `queued` word already say the state, and where in the line a row stands is a
// detail of one row rather than a column. The sentence survives where it is
// read on purpose — the chat's waiting card over the composer and the chat
// header — and this file is what keeps it off the rows.
//
// WHAT IS LEFT HERE IS THE PRESS: Force start, on every waiting row including
// the head of the line, reachable and posting to the one endpoint.
//
// WHY A RENDER TEST AND NOT A SOURCE-STRING ONE. The rest of this feature is
// pinned by reading source (project-queue.test.ts), which is cheap and says
// nothing about whether a control is REACHED. So this one mounts the row and
// dispatches a press the way React would — inner handler first, outward until
// something stops it.
