// WHO A TASK PANEL IS ABOUT — the status ring, TASK-nnn, the title, and the
// project this task runs in.
//
// It was written inside `shell/TaskPeek.tsx`'s header and lives here because a
// SECOND surface draws it now: the native chat's own top line, whenever the
// conversation on screen has a task row behind it (Akshil, 2026-09-14 — "reuse
// the task side-peek header identity block"). The chat used to print a ✻ Claude
// wordmark, the target's name and a session number, which are three facts about
// the tool and its file and none about the task — and a reader moving between
// the peek and the chat had two different headers for the same conversation.
//
// EXTRACTED, NOT COPIED, and the classes are the peek's own (`styles/
// task-peek.css`): the point is that the two headers cannot drift, and two
// stylesheets for one block is exactly how they would. `TaskPeek` renders these
// components unchanged, so its header is the same markup it was.
//
// A MODULE OF ITS OWN rather than an export from `TaskPeek.tsx`: that file
// hosts `@apps/claude`'s `ChatMount`, so a chat importing it would close an
// import cycle — and the boundary check (scripts/check-boundaries.mjs) opens a
// hole for named shell modules one file at a time for the same reason.
