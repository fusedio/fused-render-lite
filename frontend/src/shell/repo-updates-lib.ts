// behind GET /api/git-upstream): it already reports only repos with a

 * return read as a genuine arrival and (since D574) POPPED THE PANEL OPEN over
 * whatever the user was doing. For anyone on a long-lived feature branch,
 * permanently behind, dismissal was durably useless.
 *
 * `behind` and `branch` are what the row is actually claiming — "this branch
 * is N commits behind" — so the dismissal expires exactly when that claim
 * changes: new upstream commits arrive, or the user checks out something else.
 * `RepoStatus` carries no HEAD sha, so `behind` is the closest honest proxy for
