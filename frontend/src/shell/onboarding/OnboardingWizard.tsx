// The first-run wizard: the `/onboarding` page, four steps, every one of them
// skippable. App.tsx renders it ALONE on that route — no sidebar, no status
// bar — and redirects a fresh install there at boot (shell/onboarding/state
// has the rule). Leaving is a navigation like any other.
//
//   1 About        — what FusedRender is (download-page copy + video)
//   2 Claude Code  — installed / new enough / signed in / on PATH, with buttons
//   3 Disk Access  — macOS Full Disk Access, why, and the one button there is
//   4 Models       — local models that fit this machine, downloaded in the background
//   5 First app    — the Home composer, or a showcase local-AI app
//
// Steps 1–3 write nothing but their own STAGE STATUS for the progress meter
// (progress.ts — the sidebar's "Setup N%" row and the pills in the bar above;
// a reopen lands on the first step still to do). Step 4 starts model
// downloads, which
// are server-owned jobs that outlive the wizard and block nothing in it — a
// head start, since a model is fetched on first use anyway. Step 5's create
// (or a showcase open) is the only other durable action and doubles as
// "complete". ✕ / Escape
// record a DISMISS — a different flag, so a later build can tell the two
// apart. Both stop the auto-show; neither is undone by reopening from Help ›
// Setup wizard, which resumes where the user left off.
