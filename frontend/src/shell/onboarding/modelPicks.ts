// Which models the wizard's Models step offers, and which of them start
// checked — the part with a RULE in it, kept out of the .tsx for the reason
// `apps/ai_models/shared/fitNote.ts` gives about itself: there is no DOM
// harness in this repo, so a decision a reader has to trust lives in a module
// that can be read (and driven) on its own.
//
// The offer is ONE model per capability: the curated `recommended` row
// (catalog.py's second curation axis, D425 — "the one this app stands behind"),
// never the capability's `default`, which is the smallest entry and exists to
// answer "just load something". A capability whose engine cannot run here
// (`available: false`) offers nothing: a Download that would 409 is worse than
// a row that is not there.
//
// **Video is excluded by id, not by curation.** `ltx-2.3-mlx-q4` is the
// recommended video model and it is a 28.5 GB download — one entry that
// dwarfs the other four put together (~9 GB). Onboarding is not where someone
// decides to spend that, and a total reading "38 GB" makes the step look like
// a demand rather than a head start. It stays one click away on /ai-models.
//
// **Decisions (Laya, `text-classification`) is excluded too**, for the
// opposite reason: it is small (under 1 GB) but a first-run reader has no
// idea what a typed-decision model is for until they have seen the Playground
// stage. Owner's call (2026-09-22): offer it once the Playground has a UI a
// reader can find, not as a checkbox on day one.
