// Step 4 — local models, and a head start on downloading them.
//
// The step exists because of a timing problem, not a capability one: a model
// this machine does not have is fetched on FIRST USE — the route answers
// `model_loading` and starts the download rather than refusing (ai_runtime.py
// `api_ai_download`/`_resolve_capability`) — so nothing here is required for
// anything to work. What it buys is that the multi-GB wait happens while the
// user is reading the next step and building their first app, instead of the
// first time they ask an app for a sentence.
//
// So: NOTHING BLOCKS. Start is fire-and-forget (`supervisor.load(...,
// weights_only=True)` returns the instant its thread is up), Next stays live
// the whole time, and leaving the wizard leaves the fetch running — it is a
// server-owned job, reported in the download manager like every other one.
// Skipping costs the user nothing but the wait, later, and the copy says so
// rather than implying a penalty.
//
// What it offers is ONE model per capability and WHETHER EACH ONE FITS: the
// `fit` verdict already on every catalog row (fit.py — measured footprint,
// curator's envelope, or the download's own bytes, in that order), drawn with
// `fitNote`'s own words so this step and the Playground's badge cannot come
// to different conclusions about the same machine. Comfortable ones start
// checked; a tight or too-big one is shown, unchecked, with the reason — the
// selection rule lives in `modelPicks.ts`.
