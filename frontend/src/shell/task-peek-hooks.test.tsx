// THE TWO THINGS THAT ONLY BREAK WHEN THE FLAG ARRIVES LATE.
//
// `task_peek_enabled` is read asynchronously, so a page paints once with the
// feature off and again with it on. Both bugs below are invisible in either
// steady state and appear only on that flip — which is every real load.
//
//   * A HOOK BEHIND THE FLAG. `usePeekHost()` starts false and turns true in a
//     layout effect; a `usePeekedKey()` call behind that condition is a hook
//     that APPEARS between two renders, and React throws outright.
//   * A STALE ROUTE MARK. `useNavEpoch`'s ignore list gains `peek` when the
//     pref lands, but the mark it compares a Back against was recorded before
//     that — so a traversal that only dropped `?peek=` looked like a different
//     route and remounted the page.
//
// Both are executed here rather than grepped: the failure is a render, and a
// source test cannot tell a conditional hook from a conditional value.
