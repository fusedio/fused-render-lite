// The Tasks page's two task views — the List (an accordion per task) and the
// Board (columns of task cards).
//
// What changed, and it is the whole point: the page no longer MERGES two feeds.
// It used to hold the scheduler's entries in one hand and Claude Code's session
// summaries in the other and reconcile them here, which meant the client owned
// a model — what counts as one unit of work, what its title is, which column it
// belongs in — that the server had a better claim to. `/api/tasks` now returns
// that model, already merged, already titled, already counted and already
// sorted newest-first. These components render it and decide nothing.
//
//   TASK-002   one Claude session, one thread
//   ├─ MSG-003  newest first
//   ├─ MSG-002
//   └─ MSG-001
//
// The model, in one line: a task IS a Claude session, and §1
// (the model), §3 (ids), §7 (unread), §8 (these two views).
//
// The visual vocabulary is the one the previous views established and the
// calendar still speaks — the bordered status ring, the live ping, the folder
// chip, the 260px lane, the 52px collapsed rail — so the three views read as
// one page. Those live in styles/schedule.css; everything this file adds (the
// accordion, the thread rows, the id chips, the unread dot) is in
// styles/tasks.css.

/**
 * Whether ANY hover-revealed action is drawn on this page.
 *
 * OFF at Akshil's request, 2026-08-17: "hide them, keep the functionality but hide
 * them", and then again over the message rows — "hide the hover actions for now,
 * that's what I said", said of the pencil on a message row. So the flag covers all
 * three groups rather than the task row's alone:
 *
 *   * the List task row: Mark read, Run now / Re-run, Open chat
 *   * the List message row: Edit, Cancel / Skip this run
 *   * the Board card: Run now / Re-run
 *
 * ARCHIVE IS NO LONGER ONE OF THEM (Akshil, 2026-08-18: bring the archive button
 * back, visible on hover). It is out from behind the flag on BOTH views at once —
 * it is one button on one kind of element, and a List that files a task where a
 * Board cannot is the divergence this page's whole vocabulary is written against.
 * It is still hover-revealed and still `.tasks-act`, so nothing about the strip's
 * geometry or its reveal changed; it is only no longer gated. Each remaining
 * button now carries its OWN guard on this flag rather than the group carrying
 * one, which is what lets Archive sit in its old place in the order instead of
 * jumping to the front of a strip that comes back.
 *
 * ONE flag for all of them, deliberately: a flip must restore the whole page's
 * chrome at once, and two switches is how half of it comes back. Everything behind
 * it is still built and still decided by tasks-lib (markReadIntent, taskRunIntent,
 * archiveIntent, openThreadIntent, cancelIntent), still spent through the shared
 * performers, and still tested. Only the RENDER is gated, and only here.
 *
 * WHAT IS UNREACHABLE WHILE THIS IS OFF, because it is worth writing down rather
 * than discovering: Mark read (the whole-task clear), Run now / Re-run from this
 * page, Open chat as a button — and CANCEL, which is the one that costs a
 * capability rather than a shortcut, since stopping a message that has not gone out
 * has no other control on this page. It survives elsewhere (the queue dock's card,
 * the Claude pane's own banner, and deleting the schedule from the task form). Row
 * clicks are untouched throughout: a leaf row still opens its message, a
 * multi-message row still toggles, a message row still opens its turn.
 *
 * NOT RENDERED rather than hidden with CSS, which is the one thing worth being
 * careful about: an `opacity: 0` button is still in the tab order, so a keyboard
 * would land on an invisible control and press it blind. (Archive, which IS
 * rendered, is hidden the other way on purpose — see `.tasks-act` in tasks.css:
 * hover-revealed by opacity precisely so a keyboard can still reach it.) The
 * geometry that keeps
 * the strip off the title (`.tasks-card-acts` and `--tasks-card-head-h` in
 * tasks.css) stays exactly as it is — it is what the strip comes back to.
 *
 * Annotated `boolean` on purpose: as a bare `false` literal TypeScript narrows
 * every guarded branch to dead code, and flipping the flag would then be a type
 * change rather than a value change.

 *
 * `needs_attention` wears BLOCKED'S RED with a "!" in the middle (schedule.css)
 * rather than a hue of its own: the card draws in the Blocked lane, so a hue
 * that argued with that lane would be the one place on the page where the
 * colour and the column disagree. The glyph is the whole difference between the
 * lane's two members.
 *
 * SHAPE is the read-state (2026-08-18). The centre dot used to mean "settled" and
 * was drawn on every Done and Failed ring; it now means "not looked at yet", and a
 * read one is hollow. That is the whole of the unread vocabulary on this page — the
 * grey dot that used to trail the title is gone, because a row carrying a ring AND
 * a dot a few characters apart makes a reader decode two marks to answer one
 * question. Colour did not move, so nothing was traded: the ring still names its
 * state in the hue it always did.
 *
 * The dot is drawn on EVERY column, and the CSS gate is `--unread` alone. It was
 * scoped to the terminal two for a few hours the same day, on the reasoning that
 * nothing is unread until it has finished — but a recurring or rescheduled task
 * sits in Upcoming, its next run ahead of it, while its thread still holds output
 * from a past run nobody has read. So the combination is real, and the gate drew a
 * hollow ring under a tooltip that said "1 unread". Which states can occur is the
 * server's business and taskUnread's; this component's business is to draw what it
 * is handed, and the stylesheet's is not to have an opinion about the lane.
 *
 * `unread` draws the dot. `count`, when given, is what the mark stands for and
 * turns into the tooltip — "3 unread" — and it is passed by CONTAINERS only: a
 * task row over its thread, a lane header over its cards. A leaf message's dot
 * already means "unread" all by itself and a hover repeating that is a caption on
 * a symbol that needs none (Akshil, 2026-08-18), so a leaf passes `unread` alone
 * and keeps the status word as its tooltip.
 *
 * The count never replaces the accessible name, it extends it: a screen reader
 * hears "Done, 3 unread" rather than losing the status it came for.
 *
 * AND SO DOES THE FILL, WITH OR WITHOUT A COUNT. The name was extended only when
 * `count` was set, which left every LEAF — the thread rows and the calendar's
 * popover rows, all of which pass `unread` alone — announcing "Done" whether or
 * not the reader had seen it. The dot was the only carrier of the fact and it is
 * not one for anybody who cannot see it (bugbot, PR #596). A leaf now says "Done,
 * unread": the bare word, because a leaf's mark stands for one message and there
 * is no number to give. The visual rule is untouched — this is the same one bit
 * the shape carries, said out loud.
 *
 * THE COUNT'S TOOLTIP IS NOT A `title` (2026-08-18). The browser holds a native
 * tooltip back for one to two seconds, and for a four-character readout that is
 * the same as not offering it at all. It goes to `data-tip`, which schedule.css
 * draws on hover after 300ms. `title=""` rather than no title: an element with no
 * `title` lets the browser walk up for one, and this sits inside a lane header
 * that has "Collapse Done" and a row that has the task's full title.
 *
 * A leaf keeps its `title` — the status word, no count, and a slow native tooltip
 * is the right speed for a word nobody is waiting on.

 * THE QUEUE'S CAPTION, with its one actionable token drawn as a link —

 *
 * One component for the List row, the Board card and the chat header, because
 * the sentence is one sentence: `tasks-lib.queueCaption` writes the words, this
 * places them, and no view holds an opinion about either.
 *
 * THE HOLDER LEADS AND THE PLACE FOLLOWS (Akshil, 2026-09-19). The id is both
 * what the reader came to the row for and the only word on it they can press,
 * and it used to arrive last — after a clause that had already spent the width a
 * narrow row has to give, so the one actionable token was the first to be cut.
 *
 * THE ID IS THE LINK AND "after" IS NOT. The reader's question about the thing
 * in their way is what it is doing, and TASK-038 is where that is answered — so
 * it is a press, with the holder's own title on the pointer. That title used to
 * be INK, quoted inside this caption, and it was the first thing to push the id
 * off the end of a 340px row (Akshil, 2026-09-12). A holder with no session to
 * open yet is plain text rather than a link to nothing.
 *
 * `e.stopPropagation()`: every host is itself a press (a row opens its
 * conversation, a card opens its own), and a link inside one must not also fire
 * the thing it sits in — the id goes to the HOLDER's chat and nowhere else,
 * while every other pixel of the caption goes where the row goes.

          AND A RADIOGROUP AROUND THEM, because a lone radio role is a role with
          nothing to belong to: a screen reader announces "radio button" and can
          say neither which set it is in nor "3 of 7". The group is what carries

          `display` is layout and `>` is the DOM — so tasks.css's
          `.schedule-tv-pop.tasks-pop > … > .schedule-tv-pop-item` rule names
          this wrapper as a step on the way down.

          ARROWS MOVE, because in a radiogroup they are how you move: Tab
          reaches the group and the arrows walk it (`onRadioKey`). Roving
          tabindex for the same reason — a group is ONE tab stop, and 28 folders

 * expanded to all 89. A mark that covered less here than there would be a rule

   *     by itself. A MESSAGE row is what addresses one turn, and it still does.
   *   * a row with NO session opens THE EDIT FORM on its scheduled run, when it
   *     has one (tasks-lib.upcomingEditEntry — the lane, exactly one message, and
   *     which entry). Such a row has no conversation to open and its whole content
   *     is an instruction that has not run yet, so the form is the only thing its
   *     press could honestly mean (Akshil, 2026-08-17: "when i click on upcoming
   *     tasks i think they should open up the edit modal... only for 1 message
   *     tasks"). Reached through `onEditEntry`, the same callback the thread's own
   *     Edit button and the calendar popover spend.
   *
   * There is no third arm for the LEAF-with-a-session that used to open its one
   * message: `chat` covers it, and one message is the whole chat anyway.
   *
   * A task with no session AND no resolvable entry (a `pending:<entry>` an older
   * server sent no next-run fields for) still does nothing, and does not
   * ADVERTISE a press either — see `pressable` below.
   *
   * NOTHING IS MARKED READ ON THE EDIT ARM: the message it opens the form for has

            `--tasks-caret-w` is the first term of `--tasks-rail-x`, which every
            indent on this page is measured from (tasks.css), so dropping the
            element on a one-message row would slide that row's status ring — and
            the whole rail it stands in — a mark and a gap to the left of its
            neighbours' and turn a column of rings into a zigzag. So the box stays
            and only the glyph goes.

            IT IS THE ONLY WAY TO EXPAND A ROW, since 2026-08-18 — the row's own
            press opens the conversation now (see `activate`). So it is a real
            button with a real label, and its HIT ZONE is far bigger than its ink:
            tasks.css grows it to the row's full height and out to the row's
            leading edge with padding, and takes the growth back out of the layout
            with matching negative margins, so nothing moves by a pixel and there
            is no thin 16px target to aim at. It also sits ABOVE the stretched row
            link, which is what keeps the two zones apart: gutter expands,
            everything else opens. `stopPropagation` is belt and braces — the link
            is a sibling, not an ancestor — and costs nothing.

            The rotation is on the inner glyph, not the button: see tasks.css.

            …AND THE GUTTER ITSELF IS NOT DRAWN IN THE CHAT VARIANT (Akshil,
            2026-09-14). The argument above is about a COLUMN of rows that must
            share one rail — a row with a chevron beside rows without one. The
            borrowed list has no chevron on any row, so the slot there is 16px
            plus a gap of nothing at the head of every row, and the status ring
            — the first ink the reader sees — stood a mark and a gap inside the
            panel's own content edge. Nothing zigzags when the whole list drops
            it together. */}

            slot to the right of this one, so the indent that says "these belong to
            that" is a whole mark wide rather than an arbitrary gap. The caret stays
            outside the column, in the gutter to its left, because it is the
            accordion's control and not part of it.

            IT IS ALSO THE ROW'S UNREAD MARK (2026-08-18). There was a separate
            grey dot after the title for a day, and before that a numeric pill in
            the same slot; the ring's centre now carries the fact instead, filled
            while anything in this task's thread is unread and hollow once it is
            all read. One mark, two facts — hue for the state, shape for whether
            anybody has looked — rather than two marks at opposite ends of a title
            that a reader has to pair up. `unread` is the merged count this row is
            DRAWING, so the ring hollows on the row's own press rather than on the
            next poll, and it is the count the tooltip names. */}
        {/* THE MARK SLOT: the ring at rest, the Archive button under the pointer,
            in the same box (`.tasks-rowmark`, tasks.css).

            The two used to be at opposite ends of the row — the ring in the rail
            and Archive out by the folder chip — which made "file this away" a
            control the reader had to travel to, and put a hover-revealed button
            in the one part of the row that is already the busiest (id, folder,
            two times). The swap costs nothing to read: a row being pointed at is
            a row whose status the reader has just read, and it is the same
            gesture every list of this shape uses.

            The button is ABSOLUTELY positioned inside a slot sized to the ring,
            so it is out of flow and no pixel of the row can move when it appears
            — the rail (`--tasks-rail-x`), the thread's indent under it and the
            caret's hit zone to its left are all untouched. */}

              draws that direction's glyph and calls that direction's verb.

              ON AN ARCHIVED ROW IT IS THE ONLY BUTTON (showsRowActions, above).
              Unarchive beside a Re-run would suggest the two are related, and the
              one thing this gesture must never be read as is starting work.

              THE ONE ROW ACTION NOT BEHIND SHOW_ROW_ACTIONS (Akshil, 2026-08-18:
              bring the archive button back, visible on hover). Filing a task away
              had no press anywhere in the List while the strip was off — the only
              route was switching to the Board, expanding the Archive lane and
              dragging — which made the honest answer to "can a task be deleted?"
              (no: it is archived) barely true on this view.

              HOVER-REVEALED, not permanent: a list at rest must grow no chrome
              (§2 — only critical actions get visible buttons), and this is one
              button on every row that has ever run. `.tasks-act` in tasks.css
              owns that, and it does it with `opacity` plus a `:focus-visible` arm
              rather than `visibility`/`display`, so the button stays in the tab
              order and lights up for a keyboard that lands on it. It is still not
              rendered at all on a task with nothing to file, which is the
              difference that matters: hidden-until-hover is for a live control,

            The board has a card to grow; a list has a rhythm to keep.

            NO WIDTH AND NO BREAKPOINT (tasks.css): it shrinks before the title

            idea how wide the pane is and must not pretend to.

            THE WORDS GET THEIR OWN SPAN, and it is not decoration: this element
            is an `inline-flex` box, and `text-overflow` never reaches a flex
            item — so the caption clipped mid-glyph instead of trailing off, and
            at a 400px pane it and the title BOTH shrank to nothing (browser QA
            round 2). The span is the block-with-inline-content an ellipsis
            needs; the shrink order is the stylesheet's.

            NO ⤒ AND NO SECOND COLOUR ANY MORE (Akshil, 2026-09-19). A skipped
            row used to lead with the glyph and repaint the whole sentence in the
            queued hue, which made one row in the column look like a different
            KIND of thing — where all a skip does is change the ORDER, and the
            new order is what the caption already prints. The glyph is the Run
            next BUTTON's face (its seat is in the hover strip below) and
            nothing is decorated with it.

            AND A PRESS HERE IS A PRESS ON THE ROW (Akshil, 2026-09-19: clicking
            the caption of a queued row did not open its chat). This span is
            `z-index: 2` over the stretched `.tasks-rowlink` — it has to be, for
            its own tooltip — which made the whole caption a dead run of pixels,
            the identical fault the file mark above was fixed for. So it spends
            the same three gestures the mark does. The `TASK-x` link inside it

            of it there is — a task with one prompt and a task with forty read
            identically until you opened them, which is the wrong thing to have
            to do to choose which to open.

            THE WORD, NOT A GLYPH (Akshil, 2026-08-23, second pass). It began as
            a speech bubble and a number, on the argument that the row's busiest
            end could not afford three more characters.

            **Reversed by request (D448): the bubble is back, after the number.**
            The argument against it was that a reader has to LEARN what the glyph
            means before the row reads — true exactly once, and paid back on
            every row after it, on a page whose rows are read by sweeping a
            column. What made the old "4" ambiguous was that it stood alone
            between a folder and a time; a number with a bubble welded to its
            right is not that number. The noun survives for anything that cannot
            see the glyph, as this element's `aria-label`.

            ALWAYS DRAWN, AND NEVER BELOW ONE (Akshil, 2026-08-24). It used to be
            gated on `> 0`, on the reasoning that zero is a thread that has not
            started and "0 messages" is worse than the space it fills. The gate
            was right about the words and wrong about the rows: the tasks that
            count zero are the EMPTY SESSIONS — a session holding only a `/clear`,
            a 97-byte file holding only a title record — and they are scattered
            through the list, so the column of counts had holes in it exactly
            where the odd rows were. A hole in a column reads as a broken row (the
            same argument the time beside it settled on 2026-08-18), and it drew
            attention to the rows that least deserved it.
            So the floor is one. A session that exists is a conversation somebody
            opened; a count of zero is an artefact of what this app declines to
            COUNT — slash commands, skill injections, tool results are all real
            entries that are not prose — rather than a fact about the row. Showing
            "1" for them is the honest reading of "there is something in here",
            and it is what the ask asked for.
            (The deeper bug is real and is NOT fixed here, by decision: one
            session on this machine holds 25 assistant turns and counts zero
            because none of its user entries is typed prose. This default is the
            preventive fix; the counter is a separate job.) */}

          {/* THE UNSENT LINE, AT THE HEAD OF THE THREAD (Akshil, 2026-09-12).
              The row already wears the red `Draft` chip, which says THAT there
              are words here; expanding it used to show the thread without them,
              so the one place a reader goes to read this conversation was the
              one place the newest thing in it was missing.

              It is drawn as a MESSAGE ROW because that is what it is about to
              be: same class, same seats, same quoted body, same relative time,
              so the thread reads as one column with a line at the top that has
              not gone yet. Three things differ, and each is the fact itself:

                * THE SEAT WHERE THE RING GOES holds the pencil instead, in the
                  error colour — the chip's own mark and the chip's own red, so
                  the mark on the row and the line under it are visibly the same
                  news. A status ring would be the wrong glyph outright: the
                  statuses are about runs, and nothing has run.
                * THE ID IS THE NEXT ONE (tasks-lib.nextMessageId, the client
                  half of tasks_store.format_message_id). These words have no
                  message and so no id, but they stand in the id column, and what
                  they can honestly say is which message they would be.
                * IT IS NOT A LINK. Every other row here addresses a turn in the
                  transcript (`msg=`); this one addresses nothing — there is no
                  turn — so there is no anchor to ⌘-click into a tab. Its press
                  is the TASK's (`activate`), which is the same thing the row
                  above it does and the only honest destination: the composer
                  holding these words is at the end of that chat.

              OUTSIDE `view.messages`, deliberately: the cap, the `hidden` count
              and the "Loading N more…" line are all arithmetic about what the
              SERVER holds, and a row the client drew from a joined draft is not
              one of those. Adding it there would have made a thread of three
              report four and then fetch the missing one for ever.

              A DRAFT ROW never reaches this: both kinds carry `message_count: 0`
              (routers/tasks.py `_draft_row`, `_new_chat_draft_row`), so
              `isExpandable` is false and there is no thread to head — including
              the session-bound task draft, which has a session but still no
              messages of its own. The one row that draws this is an ordinary
              conversation whose composer is holding something — or a New task
              form bound to it, which is the same question to the reader and a
              different place to send them (`pressDraftLine`). */}

              pressed again. Removing the cap removed that by accident — the fetch

 * behind it come back from `GET /api/drafts` only once the drop has happened.

        {/* The head is the card's marks — the id, the live ping, and a status ring
            only when that ring has something to say.

            The ring earns its place on a card by DISAGREEING with the lane, and is
            silent when it would only repeat it. A card is never read outside the
            lane it was filed into, and that lane's header already carries the ring
            and the word ("◯ UPCOMING 9"), so on the common card — status and lane
            being the same fact — the ring next to the id was the column saying its
            own name a second time (Akshil, 2026-08-17: "that is just repetitive
            here").

            Which leaves the one card where they are NOT the same fact. `failed` is
            a flag beside `status`, not a value of it, and the two disagree in
            exactly one direction (server routers/tasks.py `_failed`): a broken run
            triaged to Done or Archive, or one whose session is live again, keeps
            the flag while the lane says something else. Those cards sit under a
            header that does not mention the failure, and the red ring is the only
            thing on them at rest that does — the hover-revealed Re-send is not a
            signal, it is a control. So the ring is conditional, not absent, and
            `failedOffLane` above is the whole rule.

            Nothing about the ring itself changes: same component, same
            `--status-failed` token, same 16px. And the head holds
            `--tasks-card-head-h` whether or not the ring is in it (tasks.css), so a
            card does not change height when it gains or loses one — a lane of cards
            that jittered by the width of a glyph would be a worse tell than the
            repetition this removed.

            List and Calendar keep their ring unconditionally: a row in a flat list
            and a chip in a day cell have no lane above them, so there the ring is
            the only thing that files them at all.

            AND UNREAD IS NOT IN THIS HEAD AT ALL. It took three tries to get there
            (all 2026-08-18): the ring's filled centre, which meant widening the
            condition above and putting the repetition straight back; then a small
            filled dot in the status hue leading the head, which stopped repeating
            the lane but spent a whole glyph — and a card is three short lines, so a
            fourth mark on it is the crowding again in a new place. It is the
            TITLE'S WEIGHT now: unread cards read bold, read cards read normal. See
            the title below.

            THE SECOND SUCH CARD is a waiting one (2026-09-03). Its status is
            `needs_attention` and its lane is Blocked — genuinely two different
            facts about it, which is the exact condition above — so it wears its
            own amber ring for the same reason and by the same rule. It is also
            the difference between "somebody has to look at this eventually" and
            "somebody has to answer this now", which is worth a glyph.

            So the head is the id, and a ring on the one card whose status its lane
            does not mention. */}

              before the folder, which is the card's own reading of "immediately
              before the project tag": the foot IS this card's right-hand end. */}

        {/* Nothing trails the title any more (2026-08-18). Three arrangements of
            an unread mark lived in this slot and each one was a fix for the last:
            a numeric pill inside the title's two-line `-webkit-box` clamp, which
            clipped it away on exactly the busiest cards; the same pill lifted into
            a `flex-wrap` wrapper beside the title, where any two-line title
            orphaned it onto a line of its own (the screenshot Akshil sent on
            2026-08-17); and then a dot back inside the flow once schedule.css
            dropped the clamp for good.

            The clamp's removal STAYS — the title wraps freely, `overflow-wrap:
            anywhere` is the only guard it needs, and long titles make taller cards,
            which is accepted. What went is the ATOM: no pill, no dot, nothing in
            the flow after the last word.

            UNREAD IS THE TITLE'S WEIGHT (Akshil, 2026-08-18, after three marks in
            this slot and one in the head). Bold when there is something unread,
            normal when there is not — no glyph, so the card gains no fourth thing
            to read, and the signal is on the very words a lane is scanned for. It
            is also the mark this page already uses one level down: an unread MESSAGE
            row bolds its body (`.tasks-msg.is-unread`), and a card is the same claim
            about a whole thread.

            IT STAYS OFF THE LIST ROW, deliberately. A row already carries the
            ring-dot and that is its primary signal; bolding the title as well would
            state one fact twice on one line, which is exactly the double-signalling
            the ring was introduced to end. The Board has no ring to spare on a
            quiet card — that is why it needs a different mark at all — so the two
            views differ HERE precisely so they agree about everything else.

            AND WEIGHT IS NOT A FACT A SCREEN READER HAS (bugbot, PR #596). Bold is
            the whole visual signal here, and `font-weight` reaches the
            accessibility tree not at all — so an unread card and a read one were
            the same card to anybody not looking at it. The words are added instead,
            in a span that is hidden from the eye and not from the tree
            (`.tasks-said`): the card is a `<button>` whose accessible name is
            computed from its contents, so ", 3 unread" after the title lands in
            that name in the right order, with no `aria-label` overriding the id and
            title a reader actually wants to hear first.

            Deliberately NOT `aria-label` on the button: that REPLACES the computed
            name, so the card would announce its unread count and lose "TASK-044,
            Pull today's news" — trading one missing fact for two. And deliberately
            not an `aria-label` on this span either: a role-less span's label is not
            reliably announced (the same reason ScheduleCalendar gives its own dot a
            `role="img"`), where real text always is. */}

            is identity (which folder, is it still there) and this is state, and
            a queued lane's whole reason to exist is that this sentence is the
            one thing the reader came to the card for.

            NO WIDTH ANYWHERE ON IT, and that is deliberate rather than
            incidental. A lane is 260px, the sentence is "after TASK-1041 | 12th",
            and a folder name or an id can be any length — so it
            WRAPS (tasks.css) and the card gets taller, exactly as a long title
            already makes it taller. A fixed width here would clip the id, which
            is the only part of the sentence a reader can act on.

            NO ⤒ AND NO SECOND COLOUR (Akshil, 2026-09-19). The card that had
            been skipped used to lead with the glyph and turn the whole sentence
            yellow — a highlight on a state that is not a state: a skip moves
            this card's PLACE, and the place is the sentence. One register for
            every waiting card in the lane, and the order is what tells them
            apart. */}

                A TAG HERE TOO, unlike the folder chip beside it, and the
                difference is deliberate (design.md, Round 2: the filter is
                "List + Board"). The folder stays a label on a card because a
                card is a drag target first; this chip is the only control the
                draft filter has, so leaving it inert on the Board would mean
                the Board could show the filter's ON state and never turn it
                off. The cost is bounded in a way the folder's was not: the
                cards that carry it are mostly drafts, and a draft card does not
                lift at all (tasks-lib.LANE_EXITS.draft is empty). */}

          row actions: a lane is a column of cards, and a permanent glyph on
          every one of them would compete with the titles the lane exists to
          show.

          ONE row holding both, rather than two independently pinned buttons:
          a card can offer Run now AND Archive (a failed task with a spent
          message offers exactly that pair), and two absolutely-positioned
          siblings both anchored to `right` would sit on top of each other. The
          strip is laid out by flex and pinned once, so each button is placed by
          the row instead of by its own coordinates.

          They are SIBLINGS of the card, not children of it, which is also what
          keeps them out of the card's own click: pressing Archive or Run now
          cannot bubble into a button it is not inside, so neither one navigates
          to the conversation or marks the thread read. That was already true of
          the markup and it is now load-bearing, so a test reads it.

          RUN NOW IS BEHIND SHOW_ROW_ACTIONS, off since 2026-08-17. ARCHIVE IS
          NOT, since 2026-08-18: Akshil asked for the archive button back on hover,
          and it is the same button on the other view, so keeping it flagged here
