// The Tasks page's pure half — everything the List accordion and the Board
// decide, with no DOM and no React in it, so the rules are testable on their
// own (shell/tasks-lib.test.ts) and the components are left holding markup.
//
// The model:
//
//   PROJECT (a folder)
//   └─ TASK-002        one Claude session, one thread
//      ├─ MSG-003      newest first
//      ├─ MSG-002
//      └─ MSG-001
//
// The server hands us that shape already merged, already titled, already
// counted and already sorted (newest task first). Nothing here re-derives a
// status or re-titles a row: the one place those are decided is the server, and
// a client that guesses a second answer is a client that disagrees with itself
// on the next poll.
//
// ORDER HAS EXACTLY ONE EXCEPTION, and it is named: sortLane, applied by
// groupByColumn. It is not the Board's alone any more — the List and the Cards
// wall read that very map, flattened (`sortForList`, 2026-09-14), so there is
// one ordering function on this page and not three that agree by inspection.
// `filterTasks` below still filters and nothing else: filtering and ordering are
// separate passes, and the order is decided in exactly one of them.
//
// A LANE is a narrower question, and Upcoming's is the opposite one. A column of
// work that has not happened yet is read to find out what happens NEXT, and
// "most recently touched" is not that: a task edited an hour ago and due in
// October outranks the one firing in ten minutes (Akshil, 2026-08-17: "in
// upcoming the most recent tasks [close to current time] would be on top, in
// done and failed the recent runs will be on top"). So Upcoming runs SOONEST
// FIRST — ascending — and the settled lanes run most-recent-run first, which is
// the same instinct pointed at the past.
//
// This is a presentation of the same data, not a second opinion about it: no
// status is re-derived, no lane membership is re-decided (taskColumn still asks
// the server), and every key is a time the server itself sent.

 * so a reader carries one vocabulary between the two:
 *
 *   * `running` — the turn is in flight (amber, `--status-progress`).
 *   * `queued` — its time has come and its folder is busy (the SAME yellow,
 *     `--status-queued` is an alias of `--status-progress`; the ring is dashed,
 *     which is the whole of the difference), the lane's waiting half.
 *   * `failed` — settled badly, whatever spelling of badly.
 *   * `done` — settled.
 *
 * …plus `scheduled` for a message whose time has NOT come, which is not a queue
 * state at all and must not be dressed as one, and the archive's own two words
 * (`cancelled` / `skipped`) for a message nothing will ever do again.
 *
 * QUEUED IS THE MESSAGE'S OWN TWO FACTS — past due, still pending — and nothing
 * else (schedule-lib's `queueRole` fallback rule, which that module already calls
 * "not a guess"). It asked the TASK as well until 2026-09-12, and that second
 * half was wrong for the commonest shape this feature makes: a task whose first
 * message is RUNNING reads `in_progress`, never `queued`, so its own second
 * message — pending, overdue, and held behind the very turn in flight above it —
 * printed `scheduled`, which says "its time has not come" about a message that is

/**
 * What a TASK row says about its whole thread — the counterpart of unreadMarker,
 * which speaks for one message.
 *
 * The two are drawn in the same place now (trailing the title) and in the SAME
 * MARK, and that is the last of four passes:
 *
 *   * The dot moved to the head of every MESSAGE row, because a thread is scanned
 *     down its left edge and a marker at the right end is missed entirely
 *     (Akshil, 2026-08-16: "on the right hand I missed it").
 *   * The task's count followed it to the left, so the rail would not start
 *     halfway down the node.
 *   * And that was wrong, because the two rows are not the same question. A list
 *     is scanned for its TITLES, and a number in front of every one of them
 *     announced the messages before the work they are about — it "breaks the
 *     reading priority" (Akshil, 2026-08-17). So both marks went to the end of
 *     their title.
 *   * And then the NUMBER went too (Akshil, 2026-08-17: "only show a single dot
 *     like the notification that we show"). A row said `211` and a card said `13`
 *     — a readout nobody acts on per unit, where the only decision it feeds is
 *     "is there anything new here?". That is one bit, so it is drawn as one bit,
 *     in the very mark the message rows already use.
 *   * And then the mark left the title altogether (Akshil, 2026-08-18). A dot
 *     after the words was a SECOND glyph on a row that already carries one — the
 *     status ring — and two marks a few characters apart, one saying "this
 *     finished" and one saying "you have not looked", is a row a reader has to
 *     decode rather than scan. So read-state moved INTO the ring: the centre dot
 *     that used to mean "settled" now means "settled AND unread", and a ring gone
 *     hollow is the whole of "you have seen this". Colour is untouched, so the
 *     ring still says WHICH terminal state in exactly the hue it always did, and
 *     the row is back to one mark carrying two orthogonal facts — shape and hue.
 *
 * So there is no pill, no digit and no trailing dot: a task with unread wears a
 * filled ring (ScheduleTaskViews.StatusIcon, `.schedule-ring--unread`), the same
 * mark its own unread messages wear one level down, and the same mark the board
 * lane's header wears one level up.
 *
 * THE COUNT IS NOT LOST, it is only unprinted — taskUnreadLabel below returns the
 * accessible name, and it names the real number. A reader who cannot see the ring
 * gets more than the sighted one, which is the right way round for a mark whose
 * whole visual job is to be noticed rather than read.

 * while the mark did not, which is two vocabularies for one fact again. The
 * count is the part a reader acts on; what it counts is whatever they are
 * hovering.
 *
 * Uncapped, and the same shape at one. The old pill printed "99+" past a cap
 * because a three-digit number does not fit a 16px chip; a tooltip has no such
 * constraint, and the name it carries is the whole of what the row knows.
 *
 * LEAVES DO NOT GET ONE. A single unread message's dot means exactly "unread"

// scheduled for next Tuesday.
//
// Two rules decide it, and both are about honesty rather than convenience.
//
// 1. Only a `pending` message. `sending` is deliberately not cancellable
//    server-side (schedule.cancel) — the helper is away and the turn may have
//    started, so "cancelled" would be a claim nothing can make good on — and a
//    sent/missed/errored message has already had its whole life.
//
// 2. On an OCCURRENCE of a recurring rule, the id sent is the occurrence's own,
//    never its template's. This is the one place the thread's two affordances
//    deliberately disagree: Edit resolves an occurrence UP to its template
//    (changing "next Tuesday's run" means changing the rule, because there is
//    nowhere else for the change to live), while Cancel stays DOWN on the
//    occurrence. The server reads it exactly that way — cancelling a template
//    stops every further run, cancelling an occurrence skips that one and the
//    next materialisation pass carries on — so a Cancel that resolved upward
//    like Edit does would silently delete a schedule the user meant to skip one
//    run of. Since the two mean different things, the button says which one it
//    is doing: "Cancel" on a one-off, "Skip this run" on an occurrence.

 * changed; a message that has run is a TRANSCRIPT TURN, and the transcript is
 * where it is read (Akshil, 2026-08-17: "for multi-message tasks when i click on
 * the message, that should open the edit modal").
 *
 * SO THE SPLIT IS `state`, and it is the same predicate cancelIntent already
 * uses — deliberately the same, because the two questions have one answer: a
 * message the server would refuse to cancel is a message it would refuse to
 * edit. `pending` and nothing else. `sending` is mid-flight and already beyond
 * changing; `sent`, `missed`, `error` and `cancelled` have all had their whole
 * life, so a form over one would present a Save that means nothing. Note it is
 * `state`, not turnPhase: turnPhase reads `turn` and answers how the SESSION
 * replied, which is a question only a message that already went out can have.
 *
 * THE MESSAGE'S OWN ENTRY, never the task's `next_run_entry`: a repeating task
 * has several pending occurrences and the row pressed is the one the reader
 * means. Resolving an occurrence UP to its template is Scheduled.tsx's
 * `editEntry` — see the note above cancelIntent for why Edit resolves upward
 * while Cancel stays down.
 *
 * NULL ON A PENDING MESSAGE IS POSSIBLE, and then the press must fall through to
 * the transcript rather than open a blank form: a CHAT message carries no

 * has no record of it), and a listing row from an older server may not carry one

// ---- drag --------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE WHOLE DRAG MATRIX, and it follows from one sentence: a lane is what
// Claude's work is DOING, and the only thing a person decides about a task is
// whether to run it, to put it away, or to take that away back. So there are
// exactly three moves, and four lanes a card may leave.
//
//   Upcoming    → In Progress  RUN IT NOW. Not a filing decision, an
//                              instruction (Akshil, 2026-08-16: "if I move a
//                              task from upcoming to in progress, don't change
//                              the time of it, but run it and run it at that
//                              point"). The server sends the pending message
//                              immediately and leaves its `due` alone, so the
//                              row keeps reading as the time it was MEANT to
//                              run and the thread honestly shows a run that
//                              happened early.
//               → Archive      CANCEL. Filing a task away calls off the work
//                              in it; a run still booked for tomorrow on a
//                              task somebody archived would un-archive itself.
//   In Progress → nowhere      LOCKED. In Progress is Claude's output, not a
//                              verdict a reader hands down: a card leaves this
//                              lane when the run ends and at no other moment.
//   Done        → Archive      and nothing else. "Not finished after all" is
//                              not a thing a drag can make true.
//   Blocked     → In Progress  RETRY — the same run-now call, same
//                              precondition (something pending to fire).
//               → Archive
//   Archived    → anywhere     UNARCHIVE, and it is ONE move however far the
//                 else         card is carried. Lifting a card out of Archive
//                              means "this is not put away any more" and
//                              nothing else; it does not name a lane, because
//                              the lane is not a person's to name (that is the
//                              same rule that keeps Done and Blocked
//                              undroppable, below). The filing is dropped
//                              server-side and the task lands wherever it
//                              DERIVES to — Done, Blocked, In Progress — which
//                              may well not be the lane under the cursor. That
//                              is the intended outcome, not a near miss: the
//                              board shows what the work is doing.
//
// Nothing may be dropped INTO Upcoming (a task cannot be un-run), into Blocked
// (failure is something that HAPPENED, and a lane you can drag a healthy task
// into is a lane whose count means nothing), or into Done (a run says that,
// not a reader) — with the ONE exception above, and it is not really an
// exception: an archived card dropped on any of them does not become that lane,
// it becomes unfiled. The lane is the gesture's target, never its argument.
//
// THE OTHER WAY OUT OF ARCHIVE IS STILL ACTIVITY, and it is the older one
// (Akshil, 2026-08-18: "if you want to move it to in progress or done, just type
// in a message inside that chat and it will automatically move"). A message that
// arrives after the filing drops the filing by itself, server-side, with nobody
// dragging anything. The drag is the same drop of the same record, reached
// deliberately — so the two cannot disagree.
//
// AND THERE IS A BUTTON FOR IT TOO, on both views (`filingIntent`) — the drag is
// the accelerator, not the only route, because the Archive lane starts collapsed
// and "expand the lane first" is how the archive button came to exist as well.
// The button is safe to label because the move names no lane: "Unarchive" claims
// exactly what happens, where the old Archive → In Progress button claimed a
// verdict on work the reader had not watched.
//
// Legality follows from what each move NEEDS, never from what triage happens to
// be keyed by. Run-now needs a pending MESSAGE, so a scheduled task that has
// never run — no session id at all — may still be dragged into In Progress,
// while a pure-chat task with nothing pending may not. Archive needs only the
// task's key, because it is one server verb over the whole task
// (`POST /api/tasks/archive`) rather than a triage write keyed by session — so
// the never-run row can be filed away too, which is the case the old
// session-keyed rule could not reach. Unarchive needs nothing at all — the same
// task key, and the record either was there to drop or was not — so an archived
// card always lifts, including the never-run one and the pure-chat one.
//
// There is no DROP_LANES list any more. It said "the lanes a person may drop a
// card on", which stopped being one list the moment leaving Archive became a
// move: In Progress is the target of a run AND of an unarchive, and Done is the
// target of an unarchive and nothing else. Which lanes accept THIS card is
// `dropLanes`, and it was already the only caller anything had.

/**
 * THE MATRIX ITSELF: where a card in each lane may go. The table above in
 * words, written down once so `dropLanes` reads it instead of reconstructing it.
 *
 * A TABLE AND NOT A PREDICATE, which is the correction (bugbot, PR #613). It
 * was "every unlocked lane may go anywhere droppable, subject to a
 * precondition", and that quietly offered Done → In Progress to any done task
 * with something pending — which is not a corner case on this branch, it is the
 * COMMONEST done card there is: a recurring task whose last run finished and
 * whose next occurrence is booked now sits in Done by design (see
 * `_message_verdict`, server side). So the lane a person is most likely to drag
 * from was the one lane whose rules were wrong, and the drop would have fired a
 * real run.
 *
 * Re-running a task that finished is deliberately not a gesture. "Run this
 * again" on work that succeeded is an ask better made in the chat, where the
 * person can say what they want differently this time — the same reasoning
 * `taskRunIntent` gives for offering Re-send on a failed task and nowhere else.
 *
 * Every BoardColumn is a key, so a seventh status is a type error here rather
 * than a lane that silently permits nothing (or everything). The VALUES are
 * lanes — a card is dropped on a column the board draws, and `needs_attention`
 * is not one (schedule-lib.BOARD_LANES).

 * would send: not the task's work again, but the sentence the reader has
 * already written and not sent. That is not a second opinion about finished
 * work, so the exit opens — and only for the rows wearing the chip.
 *
 * A TABLE PLUS A ROW RULE, rather than a second table: `LANE_EXITS` stays the

 * error), and the exceptions to it are here, where each can say who it is for.
 * Today there is one, and it reads the same on both settled lanes.

 * is true of the DROP ON DONE (that one is an unarchive and nothing else) and
 * not of this one: sending the draft un-files the row by itself, server-side
 * and for the same reason typing in the chat does. The run stamps `ran_at`
 * after the filing's own stamp, so `routers/tasks.py::_revived` drops the
 * record on the next poll — and while the run is in flight the row already
 * reads In Progress (`_status`, rule 1). One gesture, one decision, and the
 * un-filing is a consequence of the message rather than a second claim.
 *
 * `hasDraft` is the page's one predicate for "are there unsent words here" — the

 *     soleMessage's isExpandable guard, so a REPEATING task with past runs is
 *     never this: its press stays the accordion, whatever its lane.
 *   * WHICH ENTRY, from runNowTarget — the earliest-due pending entry, reading
 *     the server's `next_run_entry` when the row names a run it does not hold.
 *     Deliberately the function run-now and the drag already ask: "the next one

 *     would let Edit and Run now act on different ones. Only `entryId` is spent;
 *     Scheduled.tsx's `editEntry` is what resolves an occurrence to its template,
 *     because changing "tomorrow's run" of a repeating task means changing the
 *     rule.
 *
 * `held` is heldMessages, as soleMessage's own is — so the message this counts is
 * the message the row is drawing.
 *

// asserting about work they had not watched. Then it was nothing at all, on the
// reasoning that any label for it over-claims.
//
// What was wrong was never the button, it was the DESTINATION. Unarchive names
// no lane now: the filing is dropped, the server derives the lane from the thread
// (`api.unarchiveTask`), and the row draws that. So there is a label that claims
// exactly what happens and no more — "Unarchive" — and the trap the old button
// was is gone with the lane it used to pick.
//
// THE OTHER WAY BACK IS STILL ACTIVITY, and it needs no affordance at all: say
// something in that conversation and the server drops the filing by itself. The
// button is for the reader who has nothing to say in there and only wants the
// card back — which was exactly the person the one-way door stranded.

// the List and the Board both honour, is a dead control there: picking it
// alone always redraws an empty grid, and it is not obvious WHY a grid a
// person just filtered stopped answering their calendar question.
//
// The filter's VALUE is still one shared `TaskFilters` (Scheduled.tsx keeps
// one control for all three views — a person filtering List to one project
// and switching to Calendar means to keep looking at that project), so this
// does not touch the value the popover reads or writes. It only asks: for the
// query this VIEW is about to run, does "archived" belong in the status list
// it hands to `filterTasks`? On the calendar the answer is always no — a
// hidden facet must never silently filter the grid to nothing — and on List
// or Board (where Archive is a real, renderable lane) the value passes
// through unchanged.
//

// chips for scheduled runs and no draft anywhere, so there it is a facet with
// no control: ignored, exactly like Archive, rather than cleared.

// point: a card's head carries the chip whenever the task's composer is holding

 * which meant a one-message task with nothing to expand showed none at all.
 *
 * WHICH time is not a new policy. It is LANE_SORTS', the map that already decides
 * what each lane is a column of: the lane sorted by `next-run` (Upcoming) is the
 * lane whose reader wants to know when the work happens, and every lane sorted by
 * `last-run` wants to know when it did. Reading the answer off that map rather
 * than off a second list of column names is what keeps the row and the lane it
 * sits in from disagreeing — and it means Archive, whose order is deliberately the
 * server's, falls through to "when it last ran", which is the only run it has.
 *
 * WHAT IT PRINTS is one relative unit and nothing else (relativeWhen): the row
 * used to end in a clock AND a date AND a folder, which is three things to read on
 * every line (Akshil, 2026-08-17). The absolute instant moves into `title`, where
 * it also gains the word for WHICH run it is — the ink cannot say that in one unit
 * and does not try.
 *
 * The OTHER run is the first fallback, not a blank: an Upcoming task whose pending
 * message is outside the window still shows the run it already made, and a Done
 * task that also has a repeat coming still has a time to show.
 *
 * AND `last_active` IS THE THIRD, which is the bug this now closes. Both run times
 * are derived from the three-message WINDOW (nextRunAt reads `next_run` or that
 * window; lastRunAt reads only the window), so a task whose window is EMPTY had
 * neither and the row printed nothing at all — a hole in the last column of an
 * otherwise full list (Akshil, 2026-08-18, on TASK-044, a `/clear`).
 *
 * An empty window is not an exotic state. A task IS a Claude session, and a session
 * whose transcript surfaces no prompt — one that holds only a slash command like
 * `/clear` — is a real row with a real id, a real folder and no messages under it.
 * The server had the answer the whole time and on the very same row: `last_active`
 * is the session's own clock (routers/tasks.py — the transcript's activity, or the
 * newest entry's `created` when nothing has run), which is exactly "when did
 * anything last happen here". Reading it is one field, and it is the field the
 * server itself sorts the list by, so the row and its position now agree.
 *
 * The word for it is "Active", not "Last run": nothing ran, and saying it did would
 * be a confident wrong answer of the kind the `at === 0` guard below refuses.
 *
 * NOTHING RETURNS NULL any more. A task with no timestamp of any kind — every
 * source zero — gets `kind: "none"` and prints NO_TIME, because the alternative was
 * a blank last cell that reads as a broken row. `at` stays 0 there and `title` says
 * so in words: 0 formats as 1970, so the one thing this must never do is hand a
 * zero to a formatter, which is why `none` is a KIND rather than a stamp.

 * One lane, in its own order. A new array; the input is never mutated (it is a
 * slice of the polled list, which React is still holding).
 *
 * TWO rules make this safe to run every 20 seconds:
 *
 * 1. TIES KEEP THE SERVER'S ORDER, by comparing the incoming index explicitly
 *    rather than trusting the sort to be stable. Two tasks that ran in the same
 *    minute must not trade places between polls — a card that moves on its own
 *    is worse than any ordering, and the lane re-renders on every poll. (The
 *    index passed is the position within the lane, which orders the same way as
 *    the position in the server's full list, since bucketing preserves it.)
 *
 * 2. A TASK WITH NO USABLE TIME GOES LAST, in both directions, and lands there
 *    by decision rather than by whatever `null` would coerce to. It is the
 *    honest place: the lane is sorted by a fact this card does not have, so it
 *    cannot claim a place among the cards that do — and the top of a lane is the
 *    slot that means something. Among themselves those cards keep the server's
 *    order, by rule 1.
 *
 * And one rule that is about WHAT the lane is for rather than about the poll:
 *
 * 3. PAST DUE COMES FIRST, on the lane that asks for it (LaneSort.overdueFirst).
 *    Read `now` once for the whole lane rather than per comparison, so the
 *    comparator cannot change its mind halfway through a sort that straddles a
 *    second — a comparator that is not consistent is a comparator with no defined
 *    output.
 *
 * Rule 3 used to carry a limit, and it is gone: an overdue pending pushed out of
 * the three-message window left the lane sorting by the later run it could see, so
 * the most urgent card could sit mid-lane. The row now names its next run
 * (`next_run`, server-side `min(at)` over every pending entry — see nextRunAt) and
 * runNowTarget fires that same run, so a card promoted here is a card whose Run
 * now sends what the order promised. Against an older server the window is the
 * fallback and the old bound is what remains: late, never early.

// ---- which lanes are rolled up -----------------------------------------------
// A lane is either an open column or a 52px rail. Two things decide which, in
// this order:
//
// AN EMPTY LANE IS ALWAYS ROLLED UP, AND NOTHING ABOUT IT IS REMEMBERED. That is
// the whole of the empty case, and it is deliberately not a choice the reader
// can make stick: a column with nothing in it has nothing to show, so opening
// one is a PEEK — "is there really nothing here?" — and a peek is answered and
// over. Left persistable, it is the one setting a reader would make once and
// then be given four empty outlined columns by, for weeks, on a board they use
// to see what is running.
//
// So the two states are stored in two different places, on purpose:
//
//   * `choices` — the reader's answer for a lane WITH CARDS IN IT. localStorage,
//     survives reloads, and is what `laneCollapsed` below reads.
//   * the peek — a lane opened while empty. Component state in TaskBoard,
//     survives nothing: not a reload, not a remount, and not the lane filling up
//     and draining again. `laneRolledUp` is where the two meet.
//
// The consequence worth stating, because it is the one a reader will notice: a
// lane they had OPEN drains, and it rolls up. The expanded choice is not
// honoured on the way down and it is not deleted either — it is simply not what
// an empty lane is asked. Cards arrive, and the lane opens again on the choice
// that was always there.
//
// For a lane with cards, two things decide, in this order:
//
//   1. What the reader last chose for THAT lane. Explicit choices are the only
//      thing stored, so a lane nobody has ever touched keeps following the rule
//      below forever rather than being frozen at whatever it looked like the
//      first time the page was opened.
//   2. Otherwise: open.
//
// Archive used to be hard-coded closed. It is not special any more (Akshil,
// 2026-08-18) — an Archive with cards in it is a column like the others, and an
// Archive with none rolls up like the others.

// ---- the List's order --------------------------------------------------------

// lane on the Board moves position here — but the List spends it as a SORT and
// nothing else (Akshil, 2026-08-18). No headers, no dividers, no counts: one
// flat list whose rows happen to arrive in status order.
//
// IT WAS HEADERS FIRST, and they were wrong on a list. The Board's lanes are a
// fixed frame, so a lane header is the frame's label and earns its ink; a list
// has no frame, so five headers over a few dozen rows are five interruptions in
// the one column a person is scanning — and the ORDER already says everything
// the headers were saying. Grouping you can see is a claim that the groups are
// navigable; grouping you can only feel is a claim about priority, which is what
// this actually is.
//
// THE ORDER IS THE BOARD'S, AND IT IS THE BOARD'S FUNCTION (Akshil, 2026-08-18,
// the final ruling on "swap places for failed and done status in list and kanban
// board"; design.md §5, 2026-09-14):
//
//   Upcoming → In Progress → Needs attention → Blocked → Done → Archive
//
// Not a second array that agrees with the board's by inspection — `sortForList`
// below is `groupByColumn` read left to right, so a change to how a lane sorts
// is a change to how the list sorts, in one edit. A reader moving between the
// two views carries ONE mental picture of where a status sits, and the only
// thing that keeps that picture true is there being one order, once
// (design-principles §1).
//
// TWO RANKS WERE HOISTED ABOVE ALL OF IT, and they are back in their place. The
// List led with Needs attention and Blocked from 2026-09-03 ("need attention a
// new status, on top of everything … in list view they should be at top") on the
// argument that a list has a top and a board does not, so the two ranks that
// want hands should own it. Sound on its own, and it cost more than it bought:
// the same six tasks read in two different sequences depending on which tab was
// open. Urgency is still perfectly legible without the reordering — a waiting
// run is red, carries the "!", and sits at the head of the Blocked lane in both
// views — it is simply not a rank of its own here any more.
//
// WHAT SURVIVES OF THE LIST'S OWN VOICE is the drafts hoist, and that is because
// the Board adopted it rather than the List keeping it: a row carrying unsent
// words is at the head of its lane in both views (`hoistDrafts`). Drafts lead
// the whole list as a consequence — they hoist inside Upcoming, and Upcoming is
// first — which is the ruling that put them there to begin with ("an unfinished
// task is the most upcoming thing there is", design.md, Akshil 2026-09-11).
//
// WITHIN a rank the rows run in the lane's own order, `sortLane`, and the
// reasons live with it: soonest first where the row prints the run ahead, most
// recent first everywhere else, past due at the top of Upcoming, a row with no
// such time last, ties keeping the server's order. This was a sort of its own
// keyed on `taskWhen` — the stamp at the end of the row — and the two agreed
// almost everywhere, which is what made the corners they disagreed in
// (Archive sorted here and untouched there; a `last_active` fallback here and
// none there) impossible to explain from the screen. One lane, one order.

 * is a seventh rank with nothing to keep in step by hand.

 * this array — the lane is the bucket, which is what `sortForList` does.

//
// EVERY CONVERSATION, EVERY STATUS (Akshil, 2026-09-05, later the same day:
// "show all status tasks in cards even archived ones"). The wall began as the
// running set alone, grew to every lane but Archive that morning, and now draws
// Archive too: an archived conversation is still a conversation worth a glance,
// and the Status filter — not the view — is where a reader narrows the wall.
//
// A CONVERSATION, though, and not a row (Akshil, 2026-09-12: "only in cards we
// don't show tasks that don't have sessions because we have no history or
// transcript of claude chat to show"). Every other view draws a line of text
// about a task and can draw one for a task that has never run; this view draws
// the task's CHAT, and a card with no session has nothing behind its frame. So
// the membership test is the row's own `session_id`, which is the one fact that
// answers it, and the ORDER is the List's — `sortForList`, one call, which since
// 2026-09-14 is the BOARD's order flattened. Which lane comes first is written
// down in exactly one place (schedule-lib.BOARD_COLUMNS) and all three views
// read it; Upcoming's cards are the ones this wall drops, so it opens on In
// Progress and ends on Archive, under Done.
//
// (Akshil, 2026-09-08: "for list as a reference in order the cards".) This view
// once kept a clock of its own there (`started`) and its cards read out of order
// against the times printed on their own heads; then it read the List's rank
// WITHOUT the List's drafts-first pass, and a card holding unsent words sat at
// the depth its last run sorted to — off the first page entirely. See
// cardsForTasks, below.
//
// So the only decisions it makes — membership, dedupe, the page — are here, out
// of the component, because they are the ones worth testing and a grid of
// iframes is the last place to test anything.

 * scheduled run's card could carry across the pending → session handover
 * without a remount (`task_id` is moved onto the session key by that
 * transition — tasks_store.ensure_ids' `rekeys` pass). That rested on ONE NUMBER

 * pairs each held two different sessions — an archived "Current worktrees" and
 * a done "Investigate Python 3.12" both as TASK-007, say — because the rekey is

 * The Cards view's rows: the List's order, one card per row, capped.

 * order the cards"). Not the List's rank with a clock of this view's own — that
 * is what was here, and it is the bug this fixes. The cards ranked by lane like
 * the List and then ran by `started` (when the task was created) inside a lane,
 * while every card's head printed `taskWhen` — the last run, the same stamp a
 * List row prints. So the wall was ORDERED by one clock and LABELLED with another:
 * a Done card reading "2h ago" sat above one reading "10m ago", the exact
 * symptom the List had already cured in itself, and a recurring task
 * created weeks ago that had just run sat at the top of Done in the List and at
 * the bottom of Done here. Switching views reshuffled the lane, which is the one
 * thing the shared LIST_ORDER was there to prevent.
 *
 * So the order is `sortForList`, the very function the List calls — and since
 * 2026-09-14 that is the BOARD's order flattened, so the wall, the list and the
 * board are one sequence: rank by lane, the rows carrying unsent words first
 * inside their lane, and inside each half the lane's own clock — last run, most
 * recent first; Archive as the server lists it; a row with no such time last.
 * Same rows, same order, in every view, and a card's place on the wall is the
 * place a reader can check against the stamp on its own head.
 *
 * THE DRAFTS-FIRST PASS IS PART OF IT (Akshil, 2026-09-12), not a detail of the
 * List: the wall shows six cards and a Done lane can be four hundred long, so a
 * task whose composer is holding a half-written reply was on page eleven if its
 * last run was a day old — which is to say, gone. The row the reader is most
 * likely to be looking for is the one they were in the middle of writing.
 *
 * WHY `started` WAS HERE, AND WHY THE LIST'S KEY IS SAFE TOO. The wall first ran
 * by `last_active`, which climbs on every write and reaches this page within a
 * second (the /api/tasks/changes fast lane), so cards traded places for as long
 * as anything was talking (Akshil, 2026-09-03: "when i create a new task the
 * layout shifts multiple times"). `started` never moves, and that was the fix
 * (PR #984) — but it over-corrected: it froze the wall against a clock nobody
 * could see. The List's key is `lastRunAt`, a message's `ran_at`, which is
 * written ONCE when the turn begins and does not tick while the run streams — so
 * a card still holds still while its conversation talks, and moves only when a
 * run starts, a run ends, or a lane changes: real events with something to say.
 * The test that pins this ("does not re-sort when a run merely writes") is kept
 * and still holds.
 *
 * TIES KEEP THE SERVER'S ORDER (sortLane compares the incoming index), which
 * matters more here than on a row: every card is a live iframe keyed by task,
 * and two cards trading places between polls is two conversations swapping
 * seats in front of somebody reading one of them.
 *
 * `now` is read ONCE for the whole wall and handed down, for sortLane's own
 * reason: a comparator that changes its mind halfway through a sort straddling a
 * second is a comparator with no defined output.

/**
 * ONE DAY OF A REPEATING TASK, as one of the app's five words (Akshil,
 * 2026-08-20, raised twice).
 *
 * A repeating task has NO SINGLE TRUTHFUL STATUS, and that is the whole reason
 * this function exists rather than some reading of the task. An hourly rule is
 * simultaneously finished (09:00), working (10:00) and promised (11:00 through
 * 23:00), so any one word about the RULE is wrong about most of it — which is
 * how the popover came to say "Upcoming" over a day whose runs had all already
 * happened. The clicked chip is not the rule: it is the rule ON ONE DAY, and a
 * day IS a thing a single word can be true of. So the pill answers for the day.
 *
 * THE RULE, and it is deliberately three cases about TIME before it is anything
 * about messages, because the day's position relative to now is what decides
 * which question is even askable:
 *
 *   - A DAY STILL AHEAD -> Upcoming. Nothing on it has happened by definition;
 *     whatever rows it holds are cron arithmetic or promises, and both are the
 *     same word.
 *   - TODAY, with runs still owed -> Upcoming (or In Progress if one is
 *     actually going). This is the case the old newest-run reading got wrong in
 *     the other direction too: the newest row on today is the 23:00 slot, so a
 *     day that had already run nine times read as a pure promise. "Owed" is
 *     asked of the slot's TIME, not of its row's kind, so a materialized
 *     pending and a ghost count the same — they are both the day saying it is
 *     not finished.
 *   - A DAY THAT IS OVER, or today after its last slot -> the day's OUTCOME,
 *     rolled up: any failure makes the day Failed (one broken run is the thing
 *     you need to see, and burying it under nine green ones is how a rule
 *     silently rots), otherwise anything that ran makes it Done.
 *
 * IN PROGRESS OUTRANKS ALL OF IT. `live` is the caller's isRunningIn reading of
 * this same day — the exact list the grid chip shimmers by — and a run in
 * flight is a fact about right now that no rollup should be allowed to
 * overwrite. A row whose own tone is `in_progress` (a `sending` message the
 * task-level reading has not caught up with) counts the same way.
 *
 * THE FALLBACK IS "ARCHIVE", NOT "UPCOMING", and it is the case worth being
 * explicit about: a past day can hold nothing but slots that went by unrun —
 * past ghosts (`missed` + template_id) that the rule skipped while the app was
 * closed, or pendings nobody ever marked. Those are not outcomes, so the two
 * rollup arms above pass over them; calling the day Upcoming afterwards is the
 * original bug wearing a different hat. `archived` is already this app's word
 * for a recurring slot that was due and did not run — it is what
 * `messageTone` files those rows under and what greys their rings in the
 * thread right below the pill — so the day inherits it rather than inventing a
 * sixth state.

 * Pure, and every input is an argument (`now` included) so the six cases above

 *
 * A ONE-OFF is its task — one run, so "the task's status" and "this
 * occurrence's status" are the same fact, and the pill keeps saying exactly
 * what the List's row and the Board's card say: `taskStatus(taskColumn, failed)`.
 * Untouched by the day rule below, and it should be: a one-off has exactly one
 * day, so rolling it up could only ever restate the task.
 *
 * A REPEATING task is a rule, and a rule's task-level column is nearly always
 * `upcoming` — the next run is always scheduled — which made the pill useless
 * on the one grid that is ABOUT individual days: click last Tuesday's failed
 * run and the pill said "Upcoming". So a recurring task's pill is `dayPill`
 * over THE CLICKED CHIP'S OWN DAY, whose reasoning lives on that function.
 *
 * WHY THIS GREW A `day` AND A `now`. The first cut of this (PR #645) answered
 * from the NEWEST real row on the day, which is right for a day that is over
 * and wrong for every day that is not: the newest row on today is tonight's
 * 23:00 promise, so a rule that had already run nine times today wore
 * "Upcoming", and a past day whose rows were never marked wore it too. "Newest"
 * was standing in for a verdict; the verdict needed to know where the day sits
 * relative to now, so now it is told.
 *
 * Always SOLID: whatever the word, the pill never inherits the projected
 * chip's dashes — a status is a word, not a drawing of a day. `projected` is
 * therefore not an argument any more either: it was the last thing reaching in
 * from the chip's DRAWING, and dayPill decides future-ness from the calendar

// ---- ONE IDENTITY FOR A ROW THAT CHANGES ITS NAME ----------------------------
// `key` is the server's row identity and it MOVES under one task exactly once:
// a message waiting in a folder's line is listed as `pending:<entry-id>`, and
// the beat its run gets a session the listing files it under the session id
// instead (routers/tasks.py `_rekeyed_pendings` — the session row and the
// pending row flagged `gone` ride in ONE payload, so the data is already a clean
// swap). What was not clean was the PAINT: both lists key their rows on
// `task.key`, so the swap unmounted the pending row and mounted a session row in
// its place — the row blinked out for a beat and came back running, worst of all
// on a task the reader had just skipped, where the blink lands on the very row
// the press was about (Akshil QA, 2026-09-18).
//
// So both halves — the merge that decides replace-vs-append, and the React key —
// ask ONE question: what is this row's identity. `task_id` is the answer when
// there is one, because a number is allocated once per task and carried ACROSS
// the rekey (`tasks_store.ensure_ids`), which is exactly the fact the key lacks.
//
// FLAG-GATED, and the gate is at the call sites rather than in here: with the
// project queue off nothing is ever held in a line, so nothing is ever rekeyed
// while it is on screen, and the byte-for-byte old behaviour (key by `task.key`,
// merge by `task.key`) is what those call sites keep.
//
// AND `task_id` IS NOT UNIQUE — `cardKey` above carries the incident that proves
// it: the pending row's number is respent when the rekey is refused, and a live
// listing held four numbers naming two sessions each. A duplicate React key
// stops a list updating, which is how the first attempt at this (reverted,
// 63bddc24d) broke live rows. `taskListKeys` is therefore the only way this is
// ever spent on a list: it hands back one key per row, unique by construction,
// and it hands back `task.key` for every row it cannot vouch for.

 *
 * THE BUG THIS ENDS (Akshil, 2026-09-18): pressing ⤒ on the 2nd row promoted it
 * to "1st in line" and said nothing about the row that was already 1st, so for
 * the 0.3-0.6 s before the server's listing landed TWO rows read "1st in line"
 * and the reader could not tell which of them was going to run. A queue is one
 * order, and a claim about one row's place is a claim about everybody else's:
 * the whole line has to move in the same paint or it is not a line.
 *
 * WHAT MOVES, and nothing else:
 *
 *   * the pressed row takes `head` exactly as the caller built it — position 1,
 *     `queue_priority`, and whatever the server said is still in front of it
 *     (the RUN holding the folder, which a skip never touches);
 *   * every row the press jumped OVER — the ones standing between the pressed
 *     row's new place and its old one — shifts one place back;
 *   * the row that was standing where the pressed row now stands is the only one
 *     whose "behind X" changes, because it is the only one whose neighbour
 *     changed: it is now behind the pressed task, id, title and link;
 *   * every other queued row in the folder keeps its number and its sentence,
 *     and only loses `queue_priority` if it was wearing it — the ⤒ glyph is a
 *     claim on the one spot at the head, and after this press that spot is the
 *     pressed row's.
 *
 * Rows in OTHER folders are never touched: a line is per folder, and a skip in
 * one says nothing about another. Rows that need no change get no claim, so the
 * common press on a two-deep line leaves two claims and not twenty.
 *
 * PURELY LOCAL AND SHORT-LIVED, exactly as the single claim was: every key here
 * is a key the next `/api/tasks` answer speaks about, so `expireQueueOverrides`
 * retires the whole set together and the server's order wins unconditionally.
