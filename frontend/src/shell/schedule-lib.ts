//
// The two shapes spell the field differently — a ScheduledMessage's turn is
// "" | "ok" | "failed" | "cancelled" | "unknown", a TaskMessage's is
// "" | "done" | "idle" | "unknown" — but the POSITIONAL rule under both is the
// same, because the field is written exactly once, when the turn ends:
//
//   ""         nothing written yet ⇒ the turn is still live
//   "unknown"  the watch ended without a verdict ⇒ nobody is reporting any more
//   anything   the turn ENDED and said so — "done", "idle", "ok", "failed", and
//   else       whatever word a newer server invents next
//
// The default is the whole point. A value this client has not heard of is a
// turn that ended, never one in flight, because the server does not write the
// field until it ends. Defaulting the other way is what made `idle` — a turn
// that finished and reported — paint as "Running…" on the calendar for as long
// as the row existed.

// ---- Board (kanban) columns ---------------------------------------------------
// The Schedule page's third view — the Inbox board's EXACT columns (In
// Progress / Done / Archive) plus Upcoming, because this board now shows every
// Claude session alongside the scheduler's tasks (Akshil, 2026-08-16). A task
// column derives strictly from fields that exist — `state` and `turn` —
// through the same collapse stateTone performs, so a card sits in the column
// its pill already claims. No drag: unlike the Inbox's triage status, these
// states are the scheduler's own facts, not labels a person may move.

// FIVE, not four (Akshil, 2026-08-17): "if we can't show failed tasks, then
// let's have a failed status, and show it everywhere. It should just be
// consistent." Failure used to be a red ring inside Done — a visual with no
// word — which meant the calendar had to keep its own vocabulary to say what
// had happened. It says it here instead, once, for every view.
//
// BLOCKED BEFORE DONE, swapped on 2026-08-18 (Akshil, "swap places for failed and
// done status in list and kanban board"). The board is read left to right, and a
// lane that wants a person's hands belongs on the near side of one that wants
// only their eyes: a run that stopped needs a decision, a done run needs reading.
//
// THAT LANE IS "BLOCKED" AND NOT "FAILED" since 2026-09-03 (Akshil: "failed
// status could be renamed as blocked … for fail retry, for block a reason"). The
// wider word is what lets one lane hold both of the ways a task stops moving —
// a run that broke, and a run parked on a card nobody answered — which is the
// point: from the reader's side those are one fact ("this is not going to
// finish by itself"), and two lanes for it would split the one column a person
// works out of. WHICH of the two it is stays on the row: `Task.failed` paints
// the ring red and `Task.blocked_reason` names it in a word, so the button can
// still be Retry for one and Open for the other.
//
// SEVEN KEYS SINCE 2026-09-12, and the new one is QUEUED — a task whose work is
// due and whose FOLDER is busy with somebody else's run (the project queue,
// prefs `queue.enabled`). It sits BETWEEN Upcoming and In Progress because that
// is where it sits in time: the work has been asked for and has not started.
//
// It is a status of its own rather than a flavour of Upcoming for the same
// reason Blocked is not a flavour of Done. "Upcoming" means a time has not come
// yet, and the reader's move is to wait or to run it now; "Queued" means the
// time HAS come and something else is in the way, and the reader's move is to
// skip the line or to leave it alone. Folding the two would put a lane's worth
// of work that is ready to go behind a word that says it is not.
//
// It never appears at all while the flag is off — the server simply never sends
// it — so a board on a machine that has not turned the queue on is the six-key
// board it has always been, and this lane is empty and therefore rolled up.
//
// SEVEN KEYS, FIVE LANES. Two statuses SHARE a lane with the one they are a
// phase of, and both for the same reason: a board is read by sweeping across it,
// and a lane that is empty except during the minutes somebody is waiting is a
// lane that teaches the reader to skip it.
//
//   * `needs_attention` draws in Blocked — its own word, its own hue, its own
//     rank at the top of the List, and no column of its own.
//   * `queued` draws in IN PROGRESS, since 2026-09-12 (Akshil). It had a lane
//     between Upcoming and In Progress for a day and that lane was the wrong
//     shape for the fact: work that is due, asked for, and about to run is work
//     IN PROGRESS in every sense a person means it — the only thing separating a
//     queued task from a running one is which second its folder frees, and a
//     column boundary is far too strong a line to draw between two states that
//     swap every few minutes. Inside the lane the two are still told apart, and
//     firmly: running cards first in the running amber, then a dashed "waiting"
//     divider, then the waiting ones by their place in the line in the same yellow
//     (tasks-lib.groupByColumn, and the lane header counts the two halves
//     separately — "1 running · 2 queued").
//
// It is still a STATUS of its own for everything else — its own word on a row,
// its own ring, its own rank — for the reason it was made one: "Upcoming" means a
// time has not come and the reader's move is to wait; "Queued" means the time HAS
// come and something else is in the way, and the reader's move is Run next.
//
// IT IS NOT A TICK IN THE STATUS FILTER, and that follows from the lane rather
// than being a second decision: the menu offers the LANES THE BOARD DRAWS, so
// `queued` is clubbed under In Progress exactly as `needs_attention` is clubbed
// under Blocked, and one In Progress tick brings the running cards and the
// waiting ones together — which is the only reading that agrees with the board a
// press takes the reader back to (project-queue.test.ts, "the Status filter").
//
// OTHERWISE THIS IS EVERY VIEW'S ORDER, not just the board's: the List and the
// Cards wall read this array through tasks-lib.LIST_ORDER (a plain copy of
// BOARD_COLUMNS' keys) and sort by the very function the board sorts by
// (2026-09-14, design.md §5). So a reader moving between the views carries ONE
// mental picture of what a status is AND of where it sits, and this is the
// single place either can be changed.

 * a SIDE pane of it — so a 420px card would spend most of itself on a folder
 * listing and show the conversation in the strip beside it, twelve times over.
 * The chat template is framed DIRECTLY instead, which is what the explorer's own
 * sidebar does (apps/explorer/Preview.tsx `sideSrcFor`) and what the canvas
 * workspace does (apps/canvases/CanvasWorkspace.tsx) — same three
 * params, same reasons:
 *
 *   `path`       the claude template itself, resolved per FOLDER through
 *                /api/fs/stat rather than hardcoded, so a user's own override
 *                (§16) is honoured here exactly as it is in the sidebar.
 *   `_file`      the folder the run is against. Underscore-prefixed, hence
 *                reserved, hence read off the frame's own URL — the template's
 *                own note above `CHAT_ONLY` has the argument.
 *   `chat_only`  the host is not showing the file, but a 420px tile has no room
 *                for the template's own preview column either, and the no-pane
 *                teardown is what that param buys.
 *   `compact`    and this one is new for this view: no top bar, no composer —
 *                the card's head says what the bar would, and a card is read
 *                rather than typed into (template.html, `COMPACT`).
 *
 * `session_id` rides the URL too, which only works because the HOST marks itself
 * a param boundary while the grid is up (TaskCards.tsx, static/runtime.js
 * `findTarget`): without that, every card's runtime would climb past its own
 * frame to the Tasks page and twelve documents would share — and fight over —
 * one `session_id` on `/tasks`. With it, each frame is its own param target and
 * each card reads the one session it was given.
 */

// All day arithmetic is done through LOCAL calendar fields (getFullYear /

// the folder does not change between renders any more than the key did.
//
// `task.project` is the folder and is decided server-side (the task's own
// directory, not its target file), so a file and the folder it sits in cannot
// diverge. It needs no storage and cannot drift between renders.
//
// The index lands in a small HAND-PICKED palette (styles/tokens.css,
// --task-c0…--task-c7) rather than a generated hsl(): an arbitrary hue clashes
// with the theme in one mode or the other, and the eight tuned ones do not.

// ---- Where the grid opens ------------------------------------------------------
//
// A 24-hour column is taller than any viewport, so the grid has to pick an hour
// to open on. That used to be a constant — just above 7am, the band a person
// actually schedules into — and it stopped being right the day the calendar
// started drawing a rule's whole past (2026-08-17).
//
// The collision: ONE CHIP PER TASK PER DAY anchors at the day's EARLIEST slot, so
// an hourly rule's day is a single chip at 00:00 carrying +23. Seven hours above
// the fold, on a column that then reads as EMPTY. That was a rare oddity while
// only future runs were drawn; past ghosts make it the common case. The anchor
// rule is right and was argued over — the opening scroll was the wrong part.
//
// THE RULE, in order:
//
//   1. TODAY WINS, when today is in the range and has any chip at all. The
//      now-line is what a person looks for first, and it sits an hour down from
//      the top so there is context above it rather than a line flush to the edge.
//   2. Otherwise the EARLIEST chip in the range, half an hour above it. The whole
//      point is that the chip is on screen before anybody scrolls.
//   3. Otherwise the old constant, unchanged. An empty range has nothing to aim
//      at and must not invent something.
//
// Then the clamps, and it is worth being exact about which one does the work.
//
// The GRID'S OWN BOUNDS carry it: a target past the bottom of a 24-hour column
// lands at the bottom, which is how a day whose only chip is at 23:00 opens ON
// that chip instead of seven hours above it, and a negative target lands at
// midnight, which is how the 00:00 case above comes out right.
//
// The LAST-CHIP bound is deliberately weak, and saying so is the point. It pulls
// the target down far enough to keep the range's last chip on screen, but never
// past the earliest chip itself — so in practice all it can give up is the lead.
// Read it as: THE LEAD IS A COURTESY, AND IT IS THE FIRST THING SURRENDERED WHEN
// THE VIEWPORT IS TIGHT. It is not, and cannot be, a fix for a range whose chips
// simply do not fit in one screen.
//
// Which is the real trade, and it was a judgement call: a 00:00 chip and a 22:00
// chip cannot both be on a 13-hour viewport, and THE EARLIEST ONE WINS. The
// failure being fixed is a column that lies about being empty. Unused viewport is
// the smaller cost and the reader can undo it with a scroll; the other one they
// cannot, because nothing on screen tells them there is anything to scroll to.
//
// Placement is the CALLER's to trigger, and it belongs to the RANGE, not to the
// data: re-running this on every poll would yank a reader who has scrolled back
// to the top every twenty seconds. See ScheduleCalendar.

// ---- A rule's own occurrences, walked here ---------------------------------------

// The server projects a rule FORWARD only (`upcoming`, schedule.py) because
// nothing behind us will ever be MATERIALIZED: catch-up creates exactly one
// occurrence, at the most recent slot at or before now, and the slots before it
// are dropped for good. That is a fact about what RUNS, and the calendar was
// reading it as a fact about what to DRAW — so a repeat anchored last Saturday
// appeared out of nowhere on the one run that went, and its shape was invisible.
//
// Akshil overruled that twice (2026-08-17): "when doing a repeating [task] in the
// past, it should show me all the chips but it should only run the last one, the
// most last one, and then in the future as is". So the backward walk is the
// CLIENT's, and it is a mirror of fused_render/recur.py's `_walk_*`.
//
// The two must not drift, so the semantics below are recur.py's and are named
// rather than re-invented: a weekly rule counts in SUNDAY BLOCKS from the
// anchor's own week (so "every 2 weeks on Mon+Wed" means the same fortnight
// whichever of the two was picked as the start); a monthly rule reads its
// nth-weekday off the anchor and SKIPS a month with no 31st or no fifth Friday
// rather than clamping; `until` is an inclusive local DATE, so an hourly rule
// ending "on Nov 11" keeps all of the 11th's runs and none of the 12th's. A
// disagreement with recur.py is a bug here, never a second opinion.
//
// `count` is deliberately NOT applied. The server bills the budget only on
// occurrences it actually creates — `_catch_up_base` walks the past with
// `spend=False` precisely because those slots never existed and cost nothing —
// so numbering the theoretical past series against `count` would be the client
// inventing an accounting the store does not use.
//
// All arithmetic goes through LOCAL CALENDAR FIELDS, never a millisecond step:
// recur.py works in naive local time, and on the two DST days of the year adding
// 86_400_000ms lands an hour off the slot a person is looking at.

 * is withdrawable.
 *
 * The rule is the SERVER'S, not the popover's idea of what looks cancellable.
 * `schedule.cancel_queued` accepts exactly `pending` → `cancelled`, so:
 *
 * * **scheduled** — pending and still in the future — is a plain
 *   `cancelScheduledMessage`. Nothing has claimed it, so nothing can race.
 * * **queued** — pending, and held by the queue — goes through `cancelQueued`,
 *   the only endpoint that can answer honestly when the claim wins the race: the
 *   entry comes back `refused` and `cancelOutcome` puts the server's sentence on
 *   screen. That refusal is a real answer to a real attempt, and it is exactly
 *   why this row keeps its button.
 * * **held** — `sending`: claimed, the helper already away — gets NO control,
 *   and the row says why in its place. The server refuses this state EVERY time
 *   ("cancelled" would be a claim it cannot make good on), so the button's only
 *   possible outcome is a refusal, and a button that can only fail is worse than
 *   no button. The row that was queued a second ago must not simply go quiet
 *   either — a control that vanishes without a word reads as a bug — hence a
 *   fourth value rather than folding this into `none`.
 * * **none** — everything else. A projected ghost has no entry to cancel; a
 *   finished, missed or cancelled run has nothing left to stop.
 *
 * A LIVE row — `sent` with a turn still running — is deliberately `none` and not
 * the dock's `"job"`. The dock earns its ✕ by polling the job registry and
 * joining the queue's `live` list onto it; the popover has neither feed, and a
 * stop button here would rest on `turnPhase("")`, which DEFAULTS to "running"
 * for a field the server has not written yet. A process-killing control hung off
 * a defaulted field is precisely the promise this module must not make. "Open in
 * Explorer" is the popover's way TO a running turn; the dock is where it stops.

// reinforcement; the word is the signal.

 * answers were visibly disagreeing: a recurring rule whose TASK is `upcoming`
 * but whose day holds one failed run wore a pill reading "Failed" beside a
 * footer button reading "Run now" — two facts about one task, in one panel.
 *
 * The pill sits beside `TASK-023` in that header, so it labels the TASK, not the
 * column of runs under it — the same noun the List's row and the Board's card
 * are, and therefore the same word. Nothing is lost by the change: each run's
 * own outcome is already the word at the end of its row in the thread below
 * (runStatus above), which is where a day-level fact belongs.

 * imports this file, so asking it here would be a cycle. The caller reads
 * `taskColumn(task)` and `task.failed` — the exact two values it hands
 * StatusIcon on the List and the Board — and this turns them into the word.
 *
 * `failed` collapses into the COLUMN rather than staying a flag beside it, which
 * is the same bridge runStatus makes and matches StatusIcon's own text exactly:
 * a task triaged to `done` whose newest run broke says Blocked, and so does a
 * task the server already filed under `blocked`.
 *
 * NEVER `projected` (Akshil, 2026-08-19). The pill used to inherit the clicked
 * chip's dashes, but the dashes mean "nothing on this day is written down yet" —
 * a DAY-scoped fact, and this pill states the TASK's status. Dashes belong to
 * projected chips and the ghost rings on projected occurrence rows; a task is
 * never itself a projection, so its pill is always solid.

// "" LEADS BOTH LISTS and is the default. It is not a model or a level — it means
// "pass no flag", which is what every task did before these were askable: the
// session detects its own defaults from the project. That is the right answer for
// almost every task, so it has to be a real, re-selectable option rather than a
// state the user can only get back to by cancelling the card.

// KEPT IN SYNC BY HAND with the chat picker's MODELS/EFFORTS in
