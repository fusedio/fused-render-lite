// The Tasks page's fourth view: CARDS — every task's conversation, side by
// side, the running ones streaming (Akshil, 2026-09-03: "like a eagle eye view
// of all chats streaming in at the same time"; 2026-09-05: every status,
// "even archived ones").
//
// It is the one view on this page that does not draw ROWS ABOUT tasks. The List,
// the Board and the Calendar all answer "what is there and where does it sit";
// this one answers "what is happening", and the only honest way to show that is
// to show the thing itself. So each card frames the real chat template over the
// real session — the same document the explorer's Claude sidebar frames — and
// the streaming comes for free: that template already polls its own run every
// 400ms, so this component has no feed, no socket and no cadence of its own. It
// lays out iframes and gets out of the way.
//
// Which makes the whole file's job the three things a grid of live documents
// gets wrong:
//
//   * PARAM ISOLATION. The chat template reads `session_id` through the runtime,
//     which climbs to the topmost same-origin ancestor — this page — unless an
//     ancestor says stop. Twelve cards climbing to `/tasks` would be twelve
//     chats sharing one session id. The boundary effect below is the stop sign.
//   * IDENTITY ACROSS POLLS. The page re-renders every 20 seconds with a fresh
//     array. A card keyed by anything but the task would remount its iframe on
//     each poll, which is a reload of a live conversation every 20 seconds.
//   * A BUDGET. Live documents are not free, so the wall is drawn a page of
//     six at a time (tasks-lib.CARD_PAGE) and grows only when asked.
//
// Everything about WHICH tasks and in WHAT ORDER is tasks-lib.cardsForTasks —
// pure, tested, and out of here, because a wall of iframes is the last place
// anybody can test a sort.

 *  back, the popup opening, the app page's Tasks tab — and a cache scoped to one
 *  mounting meant every re-entry re-resolved every folder and drew a whole wall
 *  of "Starting…" for a few hundred milliseconds first. A stat's answer about
 *  which template serves a folder does not change under us often enough to be
 *  worth that; a reload re-reads it.
 *
 *  `null` in the map is a real answer — "asked, and this folder has no claude
 *  mode at all" — and must be kept, or a folder without a chat template is
 *  re-asked once per poll for as long as a card is up. `undefined` (absent) is

              §1: a mark that moved between views would be three marks to learn.

              A TAG HERE TOO (Akshil, 2026-09-12), reversing the label this was
              for a day. The argument for the label was that the wall draws no
              draft ROW (CARD_LANES), so pressing it would empty the wall and
              leave nothing wearing the chip that turns it back off. That reads

              card has a session by construction (cardsForTasks) — it is an
              ordinary conversation whose composer is holding unsent words, and
              those cards keep wearing it after the press. So the filter narrows
              the wall to exactly the cards that can clear it, which is the
              condition the label was protecting against, and the chip is now one
              control with one gesture in all three views (design-principles §1).
