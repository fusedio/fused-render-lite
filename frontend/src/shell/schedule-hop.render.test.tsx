// cheap and says nothing about whether the card ever appears: the arm reads a
// param, fetches, seeds and opens across three ticks and a promise, and the
// live failure it was written for — the URL flashing past and collapsing to a
// bare `/tasks` with no dialog at all — would have passed every one of those
// assertions. So this one mounts the page on the URL and looks at the card.
//
// A stubbed `globalThis.fetch`, not `mock.module`, for the reason
// `Indexing.render.test.tsx`'s header gives: the modules under test are thin
// wrappers over `fetch`, and replacing one process-wide leaks into every other

/**
 * A CONTAINER FOR THE CARD TO PORTAL INTO, installed for these three tests and
 * taken away again.
 *
 * The modal chassis portals into `document.body` (`platform/ui/modal/Modal`),
 * and react-dom's `createPortal` throws "Target container is not a DOM element"
 * on anything whose `nodeType` is not an element's — from inside the render,
 * which unmounts the tree to the root and takes the assertions with it. The
 * renderer draws a portal's children in place and never looks at the container,
 * so an element by `nodeType` with a `children` list is the whole of it.
 *
 * NOT IN `testDomShim`, deliberately: `bun test` shares one `globalThis` across
 * every suite in the run, and a standing `document.body` changes what OTHER
 * libraries decide to do. Base UI's `FloatingPortal` asks whether there is a
 * body and, finding one, reaches for `document.createElement` to make itself a
 * host — which the shim's document does not have, so the popover suites that
 * pass today would start throwing on a container of `undefined`. The
 * shim stays the document those suites already agree on; this is one suite's
 * fixture, removed in `afterEach`.
 *
 * `createNodeMock` rides on it because `react-test-renderer` resolves a ref
 * against the CONTAINER its node landed in — the one passed to `create()` never
 * reaches anything inside a portal.

 * THE MEASURING APPARATUS THE PAGE REACHES FOR ON MOUNT, for the length of
 * these three tests: two observer constructors and `getComputedStyle`.
 *
 * This is what the suite was failing on, and it is an environment gap rather
 * than a race. `Scheduled`'s list measurer and `TaskPeek`'s host each do a bare
 * `new ResizeObserver(...)` in a LAYOUT effect, and `row-fit` reaches for a
 * `MutationObserver` and `getComputedStyle` in another — none of them guarded,
 * because in a browser there is nothing to guard. A throw from a layout effect
 * is not a failed assertion: React unmounts the tree to the root. So the card
 * never appears — the 2 s `waitForDialog` poll just runs out — and every later
 * read of `box.root` dies with "Can't access .root on unmounted test renderer",
 * which names the symptom and not one word of the cause. The previous round
 * read that as timing and answered it with a poll; no poll can wait its way to
 * a constructor that is not there.
 *
 * TAKEN OVER UNCONDITIONALLY, not installed only when missing — that is the
 * half-measure that made this look CI-only. `bun test` shares one `globalThis`
 * across the whole run and suites leave their own measuring stubs on it, cut to
 * their own fixtures: `row-fit.test.ts`'s `fakeRow` alone leaves behind a
 * permanent `getComputedStyle` that reads a `__style` property off the node it
 * is handed, which answers `undefined` for every node in THIS suite. So which
 * error the page died of came down to where the runner happened to reach this
 * file: a bare global on CI (`ReferenceError: ResizeObserver is not defined`),
 * somebody else's leftover locally (`undefined is not an object (evaluating
 * 'cs.columnGap')`). One cause, two spellings. The suite states all three
 * itself and hands back whatever was there.
 *
 * Inert on purpose: nothing in these tests resizes or mutates, so a delivery
 * road would have nothing to deliver, and every style reads as the empty string
 * — which is what an unstyled element answers anyway, and what every caller
 * here already rounds to zero.
 *
 * They do NOT belong in `testDomShim`: a standing global would quietly flip the
 * suites that deliberately exercise the no-observer path (`Transcript`'s
 * `settled` starts true where there is nothing to measure) or count calls
 * through a stub of their own.

// effects from firing later, against a `document.body` that had since been
// replaced or deleted — and a portal effect finding no element there throws
// "Target container is not a DOM element" deep inside the tree, which (no
