// Preferences page (SPEC §20) — the `/view/_prefs` sentinel route, entered
// from the sidebar's bottom-left gear. Its tabs (D125), the count deliberately
// not stated here since it has been wrong three times:
//   Render preferences — Appearance, Call log (capture/redaction/retention for
//     fused_render/calls.py), Accessibility, and Canvases (the feature switch
//     the shell's Canvases entry points read — D427). Always present; the
//     default (clean URL). No Tour button — the tour still runs itself on a
//     first visit (App.tsx's maybeAutoStartTour); it is onboarding, not a
//     preference. The app's OWN log is not here either: it is disposable
//     temp-dir output (D68) reached from the desktop tray's "Open app logs", and a
//     second "Logs" heading next to the Call log section only ever read as the
//     call log's own settings.
//   AI — Default model (which Claude model the chat and fused.ai reach for when
//     nothing else has said) and Hugging Face (signing in to the Hub for model
//     downloads — and NOT a preference: the token belongs to huggingface_hub,
//     which stores it, so that section talks to /api/hf/* and holds no state of
//     this page's). Both moved off the Render tab (D403): neither is about
//     rendering, which is the same reason inference engines left this page
//     entirely, and a reader looking for either was reading past four sections
//     that answer a different question. Grouped rather than each given a tab
//     because they are one question asked twice — which model, and with whose
//     credentials.
//   Fused account — sign in and out of the `fused login` provider Share and
//     Canvases run on (shell/FusedAccountSection). Its own tab, not a section
//     on Render or AI: the account is neither a rendering preference nor a
//     model choice, and before it existed the only sign-in/out UI sat on the
//     Canvases page behind that feature's flag (D427), so with the flag off
//     there was no way to see which account this machine was on, or leave it.
// **Inference engines used to be a tab here and is not any more** — it is the
// Engines tab of /ai-models (shell/AiModelsEngines.tsx). It was the one control
// on this page about MODELS rather than about rendering, and every consequence
// of changing it — which cached models can be loaded, what their engine tags
// say, what Discover suggests — is on that page, where the question it answers
// is actually asked. `/preferences?tab=engines` is rewritten to the new url in
// `platform/lib/router.rewriteLegacyUrl`, so an old bookmark still lands on the
// control rather than on this page's default tab.
// Deliberately NOT a third tab: the Claude Config panel (apps/claude_config)
// briefly sat here, and a settings page hosting a second settings app — with
// its own section nav and scroll containers — inside one of its tabs never read
// as one page. It has its own sidebar routes now (shell/GlobalSidebar).
// The active tab lives in the URL (`?tab=indexing`), same pattern as
// Templates' bindings/library tabs.
// Template bindings live in the dedicated /view/_templates view.
