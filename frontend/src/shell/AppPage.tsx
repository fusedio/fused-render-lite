// The app page — `/apps/<folder path>` (D488, widened 2026-08-26): one app
// folder — a workspace app under any shelf, or a linked app anywhere on disk —
// as a place rather than as a folder. Five tabs, named by the `_tab` query
// param (absent = overview; `?_tab=tasks`, `?_tab=files`, `?_tab=api`,
// `?_tab=doctor` — current-apps-lib):
//
//   Overview  the app itself, live in a frame — USE it here, the way the
//             explorer's file view runs an entry page (`/render?path=`, with no
//             `_preview` flag: this is a real open, and GET /render records it
//             as one, D301).
//   Tasks     the Tasks page (shell/Scheduled.tsx) scoped to this folder —
//             the same List / Board / Calendar, the same modal, a new task
//             prefilled with this app.
//   Files     the folder's files as a tree, each rendered in one of its own
//             templates (shell/AppFiles.tsx) — "what is in this app and what
//             does each piece look like", without leaving the page.
//   API       every .py in the folder as an endpoint, Swagger-style
//             (shell/AppApi.tsx): entrypoint, parameters as a form, Execute,
//             response — the api template's view, for the whole app at once.
//   App Doctor the share-readiness checklist (platform/ui/AppDoctorModal.tsx's
//             `AppDoctorPanel`) — used to be a header button opening a
//             dialog; it is a place on this page now, and the trigger carries
//             the header dot it used to.
//
// A VERSION PICKER (AppVersionPicker.tsx), not a sixth Git tab: this page used
// to frame the folder's `git` template as a Git tab, offered only inside a
// work tree. That is GONE (docs/app-page-version-dropdown-plan.html) — a
// dropdown beside the tab strip puts THREE tabs above (Overview/Files/API —
// Tasks is unaffected, it has no notion of a commit, and App Doctor always
// checks the live folder, see AppDoctorPanel) on a past commit of the app
// folder, via the same `_snapshot` shell URL param and extraction machinery
// (`fused_render/server/routers/git_snapshot.py`) the explorer's own snapshot
// preview already uses. `useAppPageSnapshot.ts` holds this page's own
// resolution of that param; every read below rewrites against it directly
// (`rewritePathAgainst`), never a shared singleton. This picker stays
// read-only and page-wide — it is not what the git column below is for.
//
// THE GIT COLUMN is a later, separate addition (opened only from App Doctor's
// "Open in git" row — see the git-peek block further down in this file for
// the full argument): the folder's `git` template beside the page — the WHOLE
// template, with its ordinary write actions (stage, commit, branches,
// push/pull) — in a slim peek of its own (AppPageGitPeek.tsx), styled after
// the Tasks tab's own side peek rather than the explorer's file-preview
// sidebar it first borrowed (owner's correction, 2026-09-22: "I just want the
// git template. not the full right sidebar."). This page is NOT read-only
// about git any more; it is read-only about the VERSION PICKER'S past
// commits, which is a different thing, and the two must not be conflated.
// There is still no Git TAB: a tab put the working tree on the same footing
// as the app and took the app off the screen to reach it, and that argument
// is what this page still declines.
//
// Opened from the sidebar's "Current apps" rows and NOWHERE ELSE (owner's
// brief): the hub's cards and the explorer keep opening the entry page as they
// always have. That is why this file adds no link to itself anywhere.
//
// Not the explorer. The explorer answers "what is in this folder"; this page
// answers "how is this app going" — the app, its work and its pieces side by
// side. The folder is one caption-click away for the operations (rename, move,
// new file) this page deliberately does not offer.
//
// Mounted per FOLDER, not per nav epoch (App.tsx): the Overview frame holds live
// app state, and a tab switch — a navigation, since the tab is in the path —
// must not reload it. The frame stays mounted behind the Tasks tab for the
// same reason (display:none, not unmount).

  //
  // This does NOT bring back the Git TAB the header above says was removed, and
  // the distinction is the whole design. A tab put the working tree on the same
  // footing as the app itself, so reaching it took the app off the screen; a
  // peek does not. Staging and committing are things you do WHILE looking at
  // the app. What the header says about the VERSION PICKER is untouched: that
  // stays read-only and page-wide, and this peek always shows the LIVE folder,
  // never a `_snapshot` tree (there is no working tree to stage in an
  // extracted copy).
  //
  // ONE WAY IN, by the owner's choice: App Doctor's "Open in git" row, which
  // until now left this page for the explorer. No header button, so the peek
  // costs a page nobody opened it from nothing at all — not a probe, not a
  // frame. The way OUT is the peek's own close button.
  //
  // The open/probe state lives in useAppPageGitColumn.ts, not here: it is the
  // one piece of this page with real behaviour to pin (the probe gate, the
  // auto-close race against `useDirMode`'s own async settling, and now telling
  // a rejected probe apart from a settled "no git here"), and this file has no
  // render-test precedent to pin it against directly (see AppPage.test.tsx's
  // header) — the hook gets its own test instead. The peek's WIDTH is a
  // separate, purely-visual concern (useAppPageGitPeekWidth.ts) kept out of
  // that hook for the same reason: nothing about "how wide" belongs beside
  // "is it open and did the probe fail".

  // One Share button opens the unified sheet (ShareAppModal): the public link
  // and the `.fused` download as two cards. The picker only ever writes/reads
  // `_snapshot`; this is the one place that turns "which version is selected"
  // into "which folder the FILE card exports" — a resolved snapshot's OWN
  // extracted tree (`snap.dir`, never `snap.app_dir`: that is the LIVE folder
  // the sha resolved FROM, and exporting it would silently ship the live app
  // labelled as the picked commit) when one is picked, the live app folder
  // otherwise. The LINK card is live only — the shared canvas is named after
  // the app's id and always carries "the app", so publishing an old commit
  // under it would silently downgrade every link already sent — and the sheet
  // says so for a snapshot rather than hiding the route.
  //
  // Gated on `snapshot.pending`/`snapshot.error` (not just disabled — the
  // click handler also refuses) for the same reason every frame/fetch on this
  // page already gates on them (useAppPageSnapshot's own header comment): a
  // click that lands mid-resolve, before `snap.dir` exists, must not fall
  // through to exporting the LIVE folder while the picker still shows the
