//   * the width clamp, including the case where the content area falls below
//     the panel's own minimum (a narrow window) — a `NaN` or a negative here
//     becomes an inline `width: NaNpx` on the panel;
//   * the baseline arithmetic: the default that keeps the column exactly where
//     it was, and the ¾ floor the middle pane stops shrinking at;
//   * the `?peek=` codec, which must carry the view and the filters through
//     untouched;
//   * the prev/next walk, which must NOT wrap;
//   * the sidebar's CROSSING DETECTOR — a state machine, and the one rule here
//     a screenshot could never check: it fires on a change of side and on
//     nothing else, so an open, a close or a swap moves no sidebar and a
//     reader's own chevron stands until the floor is crossed the other way;
//   * the store: who may open a peek at all (nobody, off the Tasks page).
