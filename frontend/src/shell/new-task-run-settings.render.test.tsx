// MODEL AND THINKING, END TO END — the card's two run settings from the press
// on the dropdown to the body on the wire (Akshil, 2026-09-18: "when we change
// model and effort from the new task modal it doesn't get reflected").
//
// Everything about these two was already pinned at the EDGES — `buildSchedulePayload`
// puts them on the wire (new-task-form.test.ts), `seededDraftForm` reads them
// back off a stored draft (same file), `schedule.create` stores them and
// `_send` hands them to the spawn (test_schedule_api.py, test_schedule_images.py).
// What nothing covered was the middle: that pressing an option in the card's own
// dropdown reaches any of them. A picker wired to the wrong setter, a `value`
// read off a stale variable or a `<details>` that slams shut on re-render would
// pass every one of those assertions and still be the reported bug.
//
// So this mounts the real card, presses the real options, and looks at what
// comes out — the trigger's own label, the draft PUT, and the create POST.
//
// A stubbed `globalThis.fetch`, not `mock.module`, and a dynamic `import()` of
// the card AFTER the shim is installed: both for the reasons
// `schedule-hop.render.test.tsx`'s header gives (module-scope reads of
// `location`, and a process-wide module replacement leaking into other suites).
