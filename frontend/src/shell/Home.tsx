//     row (tag pill, timestamp) OVER a full-bleed thumb, with a 32px mark in
//     the head's icon column. This variant DOES shimmer that square, unlike
//     the folder one below: which mark the real card draws (the app's own
//     `icon.svg`, or the generic star) arrives with the fetch, so a shimmer
//     there claims exactly what is true — and without it the skeleton's text
//     would start 42px left of where the real card's does and jump sideways
//     on the swap.
//   - "folder" mirrors FolderPreviewCard/`.fhb-card` (preferences.css) — a
//     head row over an inset thumb well. The real card's head DOES carry an
//     icon, but it's a static decorative folder glyph, identical on every
//     card and independent of the fetch — shimmering it (or even placing an
//     inert placeholder for it) would claim something is loading that isn't,
//     so both variants render NO icon.
// Built by reusing the real card's own classes rather than a bespoke shimmer
// shape with hand-measured dimensions: the browser lays both variants out
// with the exact same box model (padding, border, font metrics) the real
// card gets, so the skeleton's height tracks the real card's automatically —
// including through a CSS change neither this file nor a hand-derived
// constant would notice. Pure decoration — `aria-hidden`, with the row
// wrapper (below) carrying the one `role="status"` announcement for the
