// THE LIST ROW'S META, DROPPED RIGHT-TO-LEFT WHEN THERE IS NO ROOM FOR IT.
//
// A task row is a title that shrinks and a right-hand cluster that does not:
// the age, the message count, the folder chip and the Draft chip are all
// `nowrap` and `flex: 0 0 auto`, so once the title has ellipsised to nothing
// the row simply gets wider than the list — and the list grows a horizontal
// scrollbar, which design-principles §0 forbids outright. It was invisible
// until the side peek gave the frame a reason to be narrow (Akshil, 2026-09-13:
// scrollWidth 533 against clientWidth 504, with the bar under the rows).
//
// MEASURED, NEVER A BREAKPOINT — the rule this app already follows for the
// chat's control strip and its composer row (apps/claude/ui/fit.ts, useFitStrip
// .ts, and the reasons stated at length there). A width is not a proxy for a
// collision: the folder chip carries a folder NAME, the age carries words, and
// a number that fits one workspace's rows clips the next one's.
//
// ── WHY THE NEED IS RECONSTRUCTED RATHER THAN RE-MEASURED ───────────────────
//
// The obvious loop — hide something, look again, hide more — oscillates: the
// row fits *because* something is hidden, so the next measurement says there is
// room, so it comes back, so the row overflows again. `useFitStrip` solves this
// by measuring the natural width once and comparing against a constant; this
// does the same thing from the other end. Each droppable item's own width is
// remembered the last time it was on screen, so the NATURAL need is always
// recoverable from what is rendered now:
//
//     natural = (what the rows need at this level) + (what is hidden costs)
//
// The verdict is then a pure function of two numbers and a list of costs, with
// no feedback into the thing it measures.
//
// The pure half is here so it can be proved without a browser (row-fit.test.ts);
// the hook underneath owns the ResizeObserver and the cache.

 *
 * ── WHY THE RECONSTRUCTION HAD TO GO ────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `naturalNeed` rebuilt level 0's need by adding back a per-rung COST, and each
 * cost was measured as the width of the thing the rung hides. For the list rows
 * that is honest — a folded chip is a chip that is gone. For the TOOLBAR it is
 * not: folding rung 0 hides four label spans (147px measured) *and* takes 8px
 * of horizontal padding off each of the four view buttons, so the seat actually
 * gives back 219px. The reconstruction was 72px short at every folded level,
 * which meant `pickRowLevel` said "level 1" while the row was at 0 and "level
 * 0" while the row was at 1 — a two-cycle. It settled on whichever the last
 * observer callback produced, and in the 736-776px band it settled on 0, with
 * the New task button hanging 26px past the toolbar's right edge and under the
 * peek (measured live, 2026-09-14, frame 736).
 *
 * `FIT_HYSTERESIS` is 0 and staying 0: a band would only have hidden the flap,
 * and the flap was a wrong number rather than a jitter.
 *
 * ── CONVERGENCE ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A level whose need has never been observed is UNKNOWN, and the answer for an
 * unknown one is "go one rung deeper than the deepest level we have measured" —
 * which renders it, which measures it, which is how the walk terminates. Levels
 * only ever step by one, the sequence is bounded by the ladder's length, and a
 * level that fits is returned immediately on the next read.
