// D664's retire-toast diffing — `retiredEngines`, exported from
// ActivityDock.tsx purely so this suite can exercise it directly (C9: D664
// shipped on this branch with no test at all, and C5 is exactly the defect
// that gap let through). No render, no poll, no `window`/`document`: this
// is the same pure-function-with-a-test split `jobs.ts`/`repo-updates-lib.ts`
// use for the parts of a dock that are wrong in ways a screenshot won't show.
//
// The suite below this ADDS a render-level harness for the one thing this
// file's pure functions cannot reach: `onJobPopup`'s wiring through the real,
// default-exported `ActivityDock`, `DownloadManager`'s `useJobs` poll and
// `popupTick`'s own first-tick rule, all mounted together. `globalThis.fetch`
// is stubbed directly (not `mock.module("@platform/lib/api")`) for the same
// reason `DownloadManager.test.tsx`'s own header gives: a module mock
// replaces the specifier for the whole bun process, not just this file, and
// has contaminated unrelated suites before. `window.setTimeout`/`clearTimeout`
// are captured rather than left real, so a poll cycle advances on command
// instead of a real wall-clock wait.
