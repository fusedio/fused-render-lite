// The repo-updates notification card (SPEC §36): its OWN sibling entry in
// the status bar (D563, formerly the bottom-right floating column), one row
// for every git repo the server has noticed is behind its remote's default
// branch, with an opt-in action to fix it.
//
// It used to be rows PINNED INSIDE the jobs/downloads card, exempt from that
// card's fold and invisible to its header and its Clear button. That shape
// broke the jobs card in four ways at once: with zero jobs and zero queue
// but one repo row, `jobsSummary` (since deleted) fell through to "0 finished"; the jobs
// card's collapse toggle did nothing (repo rows were exempt from the fold,
// and there were no job rows left to fold); Clear disappeared (`clearable`
// counted jobs only); and there was no way to dismiss a repo row at all. All
// four were the same root cause — a second, unrelated kind of row wedged
// inside a card whose header, collapse and Clear were never built to know
// about it. This card fixes that by existing on its own: the jobs card goes
// back to being only about jobs and the scheduled queue (DownloadManager.tsx),
// and this one owns its own header, its own collapse, its own Clear, and a
// per-row ✕.
//
// The check that DECIDES a repo belongs here runs server-side, throttled per
// repo root, triggered from GET /render opening an app (fused_render/
// git_upstream.py — see its module docstring for the full reasoning). This
// component only polls the RESULT (GET /api/git-upstream) and renders it;
// it never itself decides which repos are behind, and it never fetches git
// directly.
//
// Same component/lib split as ActivityDock.tsx/queue-dock-lib.ts and
// DownloadManager.tsx/jobs.ts: row shaping, the branch-dependent action
// choice, the dismissal rule and the header text are pure functions in
// repo-updates-lib.ts, testable without a DOM; polling, mutation calls and
// pixels live here. `RepoUpdatesCardView` is the pure, props-in half of
// THIS card (mirroring `DownloadManagerView`) — no polling, no network, no
// `window`/`document` — so RepoUpdatesDock.test.tsx can render it directly
// with a fixed row list, the same way DownloadManager.test.tsx renders
// `DownloadManagerView`.
//
// WHY THIS FILE LIVES IN shell/, NOT platform/ — the same reason
// StatusBar.tsx gives for ActivityDock (platform/ui/StatusBar.tsx
// §"activity"): resolving a repo root to an explorer route is shell
// knowledge, and frontend/scripts/check-boundaries.mjs forbids platform
// importing shell. `navigate` (Fix with Claude's hop) lives in
// platform/lib/router, which shell may import freely — but the
// STAGED-PROMPT store this row writes into is explorer/lib territory, which
// only shell-side code reaches.

// has something to do BESIDES being read (fix the repo, dismiss the failure),
// so its controls have to be aimed at individually; this row has exactly one

// repo. The sidebar's Tasks dot is the surface that still says a run is
// waiting; dismissing here never dims it. `tasks-lib.attentionDismissSignature`
// keys the dismissal on the question's own title, so a run asking something

// `lib/notifications.ts`'s own store decided this message's tier (attention
// or trail; transient/silent messages never reach here) when it popped, and
// this row is that same decision's after-image, drawn through the identical
// `NotificationCard` every other row here uses. `dismissNotification` is
// purely client-side and in-memory (SPEC's own Constraints: no server store,
// no localStorage) — there is no request to await, no optimistic-then-revert
// shape the way a pairing or a repo row needs.
//
// A MESSAGE WITH A `page` IS CLICKABLE, THE SAME WAY A WAITING TASK IS
// (SPEC-actionable-notifications' "every row goes somewhere"): the whole row
// navigates and clears itself. One without a `page` is dismiss-only — no

 * status bar rather than pinned inside a header that survives the fold.

 * clickable button either way now (VS Code/Cursor status-bar idiom — hover
 * is the affordance, not a disclosure chevron), muted text (`.is-idle`) is
 * one "nothing here" signal alongside the outlined circle, and the idle
 * sentence itself ("No notifications", D579) lives in the panel that opens
 * beneath the chip. The chip shows the category name and ONE circle —
 * outlined when this section holds nothing, filled when it holds anything
 * (D588/D590, user: "no count. just a circle outlined or filled"). No count,
 * no percentage, no chevron: D573, D581 and D588/D590 removed those in turn.

                  either counted alone: one stuck repo plus one failed job is
                  two dismissable rows, and a reader looking at two rows and
                  no bulk action has the same "did this break" reaction a
                  count of two of the SAME kind would give them. MESSAGES join
                  the same combined count (not pairings/attention, unchanged):
                  a retained message is dismissed the same client-side,
                  in-memory way a repo row's dismissal already is, so it costs

/**
 * The stateful half that owns collapse (including auto-expand) and wraps
 * the pure `RepoUpdatesCardView` — `rows`/`dismissed`/the callbacks come in
 * as props, no polling, no network, so this can be rendered directly with a
 * fixed row list (RepoUpdatesDock.test.tsx), the same split
 * `DownloadManagerView` uses in its own file for the identical reason.
 *
 * `useAutoExpandOnNew` keys off `row.repo.root` per row and DOES open the
 * panel for a repo not seen before while the card was collapsed (D574
 * reversed the D567 finding that had stopped it; there is no dot any more —
 * D588 replaced every newness mark with the chip's single circle). Shared
 * with DownloadManager.tsx, since both sections need the identical wiring
 * around the same pure decision (`jobs.ts` `trackSeenIds`).
 *
 * Fed `visible` — the same post-dismissal list `RepoUpdatesCardView` itself
 * renders — so a row a user just dismissed falls out of the seen set with it:
 * dismissing IS a disappearance, and a repo that comes back later is a
 * genuine re-arrival rather than a re-trigger of an old one. What makes it
 * "come back" is its POSITION changing (`repoDismissSignature`, D585 finding
 * 3), never a refreshed `checked_at` — a throttled re-check that moved
 * nothing used to resurrect the row every five minutes.
 *
 * TERMINAL JOBS CANNOT OPEN THIS PANEL: `useStatusChip` has no arrival-driven
 * path at all — `open = pinned || hovered`, full stop — so there is no notion
 * of an "announceable" id for anything to reach here as. They DO count for
 * occupancy, so an emptying repo list does not close the panel out from
 * under them (code review 2026-08-28, finding 1).
