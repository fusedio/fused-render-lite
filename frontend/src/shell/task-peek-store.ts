 *
 * The control exists to get the reader out of cover, and it used to spend the
 * number a fresh open would: the remainder past the middle pane's baseline,
 * held back by `storableWidth` so the middle pane clears its cover floor. On a
 * roomy window that is exactly right. On a SMALL one that number is itself
 * cover — the panel takes its own minimum, the middle pane is left under 360,
 * and the button appears to do NOTHING, which is the worst thing a control can
 * do: nothing moves and nothing says why.
 *
 * So the question asked here is "is there a width that clears cover", in the
 * two places there might be one:
 *
 *   1. on the content area there is now. `storableWidth`'s own ceiling IS the
 *      widest non-cover width (`content − 360`), so this one step answers both
 *      "the default split" and "the widest split that is not cover" — the
 *      default when it fits under the ceiling, the ceiling itself when it does
 *      not;
 *   2. failing that, the same question with the sidebar's 188px spent. That is
 *      the open-time exception's trade made by hand (`openTimeCollapse`), for
 *      the same reason: 188px of chrome nobody is looking at, against a list
 *      the reader asked to see. Non-persisting and marked as ours, so leaving
 *      /tasks hands it back.
 *
 * And when neither clears, `null` — the window cannot hold a panel and a list
 * at once, and the header draws the control DISABLED and says so, rather than
