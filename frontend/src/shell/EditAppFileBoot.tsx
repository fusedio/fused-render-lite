// The in-shell half of `fused-render://open?file=` (SPEC §26 DL-7, D889):
// Render App's Edit button asked for a `.fused` to be opened for editing, and
// GET /clone redirected here with its path in `?_edit_appfile=`. Mounted once
// in the top document beside `UpdateNotifier` (same `!IS_EMBED` guard); it
// reads the param on first mount, strips it BEFORE any async work (so a
// reload mid-clone or a Back never re-runs the hand-off), then:
//
//   no local copy yet  → clone through the guarded POST /api/appfile/clone and
//                        move to the copy's entry page (the server sent us to
//                        Home for this case — a GET must not write, D3);
//   copy already there → the server already landed us ON that copy, so the
//                        app the user knows is on screen; ask over it whether
//                        to overwrite the copy with this .fused (the preview
//                        header's merge overwrite, D397) or keep it. Close
//                        keeps it — nothing the user edited is replaced
//                        without the Overwrite click.
//
// A modal over the running shell, not a page of its own: the owner's call on
// the gated /clone page this replaced.
