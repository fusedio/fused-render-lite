 * default.

 * CLEAR IT AND TYPE A WORD AND IT IS A SEARCH (Akshil, 2026-09-19: "when I
 * clear the path and search, it should search from projects — the same project
 * options I have in the filter beside the New task button"). The folders
 * searched are the Tasks page's OWN projects, handed down as a prop, matched
 * with the toolbar filter's own `projectMatches` — name only. Not the file
 * index: this list is small, already in memory, and is the vocabulary the page
 * uses for "project" everywhere else. No cap, because the panel scrolls.
 *
 * WHICH OF THE TWO, in three tests, all about the TEXT rather than about the
 * history:
 *   · the drop has to be OPEN — a closed list answers nothing;
 *   · the text must be something SOMEBODY TYPED. Empty, or still the value the
 *     card opened on, means nobody has said anything yet, and a field answering
 *     a search for its own default would be the card searching for itself. It
 *     is the text that decides, not a "has been edited" flag, so leaving the
 *     field and coming back answers the same way it did before;
 *   · and it must NOT NAME A PLACE (`isPathShapedQuery`): a leading `/`, `~`, a
 *     drive letter or a `..` segment is an address, and an address is the case
 *     above — recents, unchanged.
 *
 * Pure, and exported, because that decision is the whole feature and it is
 * worth asserting without a DOM (new-task-form.test.ts).

// ---- The APP's recents, which are the ones a person means ------------------
// "Recents" was two different lists until 2026-08-18. The home page shows the

// (`/api/claude-sessions`, its "Claude Sessions" strip); this form showed a
// localStorage array only it ever wrote. Both were called recents, and only one
// of them matched what a person means: someone who has spent the morning in a
// repo opens New task thinking of that repo, and the form had never heard of it
// (design-principles §1 — one noun per concept, §4 — recognition over recall).
//
// So the home page's list leads this one, from the same endpoint and in the
// same order, and it is the right shape as well as the right source: those
// entries are FOLDERS — each session's own `cwd`, canonicalised and filtered to
// directories that still exist — which is exactly what a task targets.
//
// It briefly led with `/api/recents` instead, the explorer's recently-OPENED
// FILES, whose folders had to be derived by taking each path's parent. That was
// the wrong list twice over: it is about files rather than places to work, and
// it is short — three entries on a machine that had dozens of sessions, which
// is the complaint that sent this back (Akshil, 2026-08-18).

// explorer-shaped panel in on the modal's right — the card shifts left to
// make room (see .schedule-explorer / the :has() rule in schedule.css) — with
// the room to show folders AND files. A folder click descends; a file click
// IS the pick (a task can target a file); "Use this folder" picks where you
// stand.

// Forward slashes throughout, including for Windows drive paths — the same
// normalization every other shell caller applies to `/api/config` values,
// whose `home` is a raw expanduser and arrives with backslashes there. The
// server accepts either separator; the PICKER's own string surgery (up(),
// joins) only understands one.

// says "run this in a new folder called ABC1", and the form used to answer that
// with a red line refusing to save.
//
// ONE new segment, and only one. Its parent has to be somewhere the user can
// point at, because "make the folder I named" and "build me a tree I typed" are
// different asks and only the first is one a typo cannot cause. `/a/new1/new2`
// with no `new1` is the second, and it is refused with the reason.

// cancels the template AND its pending occurrence, which is exactly "no further
// runs". Nothing in the UI had ever called it with a template id.
//
// The modal is where it belongs because the modal is already the one place a
// template is addressable: an occurrence's Edit resolves `template_id ||
// entry_id` (Scheduled.editEntry), so opening "tomorrow's run" of a repeating
// task opens the RULE. The button just had to exist.

// that would 404 is never drawn: `sending` is deliberately not cancellable (the

//
// The placeholder ASKS FOR THE TASK (Akshil, 2026-08-18), because that is what
// this field now collects. It said "Title", which is what the value is USED for
// — the row's name in the list — and not what the user is being asked to write;
// people answered it with a label ("News") and then wrote the actual instruction
// underneath, which is the split this whole pass exists to close. The question is
// the same one the composer asks, and the answer to it is both the task's name
// and the first line of what Claude is sent.

// in automatically" outlived the requirement, and a PREVIEW of the chat's own

// a long message came out duplicated, once as the title and once as the
// description. "The description is what we type in the chat box"; the title is
// what the CONVERSATION is called.
//
// So the precedence is now, in order:
//   1. the task's own stored title, if a user ever set one;
//   2. the SESSION's resolved title — Claude Code's `ai-title` record, which is
//      the "cloud summarised it" case, served on /api/tasks as `title` with
//      `title_source: "ai"`;
//   3. the session's FIRST user message, shortened — "the first message that we
//      had". Also /api/tasks, as `title_source: "message"`: the first line of the
//      transcript's first user prompt (tasks.py `_title` reading
//      `tasks_store.head`). Its sibling `title_source: "entry"` — a row named
//      from a message merely SCHEDULED at the session, because the transcript
//      could not be read — is not a step here at all; see sessionTitleOf;
//   3b. the slash command the session ran (`title_source: "command"`), for a
//      session that contains no prose at all — `/making-a-release` is the only
//      true thing there is to call one of those, and the server says so rather
//      than leaving the row nameless;
//   4. nothing. The field opens blank and the user types a name.
// Never the composed message, at any step. Steps 2 and 3 need a fetch, so they
// live in the /api/tasks effect; 1 and 4 are what `initialTitleOf` decides
// synchronously.

// How long a title derived from a first message is allowed to be. A name, not a
// summary: this is the whole point of step 3 — a 200-char first line (the
// server's own cap) is the duplication bug again in a longer field.

  // read both as "already minted" and autosaved a settings-only change — a time,
  // a model, a folder — into the Untitled draft it refuses to mint everywhere

   * `POST /api/schedule` is given the session, the entry is filed under it, and
   * the task keeps the number the conversation already has. Press Schedule

   * (`chatKeySession`, Akshil, 2026-09-17). A hop out of a chat that has run
   * opens this card on that conversation's record, and a session's record is

   * param went when the hop stopped carrying copies of what the server already
   * holds (design "one record", §1) and this const was left reading a prop
   * nobody passes any more.
   *
   * WHAT THAT COST, because it is the bug and not a tidiness point: with no
   * session the Schedule payload named none, so `POST /api/schedule` filed the
   * message as a task of its OWN — a fresh `pending:<entry>` row with a fresh
   * TASK number, sitting beside the conversation it was supposed to be the next
   * message of. One booking, two rows, and the reader's report was exactly that:
   * "scheduling a task creates double entries". `chatHopSeed` restates the same
   * id into the stored form, which is why the everyday hop (a composer with
   * words in it, a record already on the server) still worked — and why the
   * empty-composer hop, whose record does not exist yet, did not.
   *
   * So: the key when the key is a session, else what the stored record said,
   * else the prop for any caller that still hands one over. "" for a hop out of

              ONE SEAT, ONE SKIN (Akshil, 2026-09-12). Delete and Discard can
              never both be on a card — `del` is an Edit's and `draftId` is a

              are the same control under the two names the card can be in. It
              therefore takes Delete's exact class (`.new-task-delete` carries
              the glyph spacing, `.btn-danger-text` the `margin-right:auto` that
              anchors the far-left seat) and Delete's trash glyph. Two weights

              depending on what you opened. The LABEL still differs, because the

              in it. See trySubmit / saveBlockedReason.

            set large and the description quieter beneath it. Neither field
            looks like an input — no border, no underline, no filled box — so
            the top of the card reads as a document you type into rather than a
            form with two fields in it. The wrapper is what makes that ONE
            surface: it owns the block's vertical space and hands the slack to
            the description, so a two-word entry does not leave the card
            top-heavy. See `.new-task-write` in new-task.css for the whole
            treatment, including what focus looks like when there is no box to
            recolour.

            TITLE FIRST, and the prominent one (Akshil, 2026-08-17: "title will
            be the first field and then description will be the second field").
            The folder and the time are facts ABOUT the task and stay quiet
            beneath in the 26px icon gutter; neither of these two carries a
            leading icon, because a 14px glyph beside a 20px face read as
            debris and the gutter is what says "this is a detail".

            REQUIRED, and the only required field on the card now — it is both
            the task's name in the list and the first line of what Claude is sent
            (composeTaskMessage). Prefilled from the chat draft's first line
            where the form was deep-linked from a composer (splitDraft, which
            takes that line OUT of the description so nothing is said twice), and
            otherwise from the SESSION where there is one to read: its
            `ai-title`, else its first user message — see sessionTitleOf for the
            whole precedence and for what it refuses. Opened from the New task
            button, or from a session with nothing to say for itself, the field is
            blank and the requirement is what asks for a name — `aria-required`
            says so rather than leaving a disabled Save as the only hint.

            An <input>, not a textarea, and that is the whole overflow answer:
            one line that never wraps and never grows. Long text scrolls
            horizontally under the caret while the field has focus and ellipses
            when it does not — see `.new-task-title` in new-task.css. */}

                    is left under the cap and scrolls, and the footer below it is
                    a sibling that keeps its own. No arithmetic — `flex: 1 1
                    auto` with `min-height: 0` against a `flex: 0 0 auto` footer
                    is what makes "the total never exceeds the cap" a fact about
                    the layout rather than a number to keep in step.

              They live at the BOTTOM of More options, under Permissions, and
              that is the whole reason they are askable at all rather than
              prominent: a model is the rarest thing anyone changes about a
              task, and both default to "Default", which sends nothing and lets
              the session detect the project's own config. Nothing about them
              appears on the task row or the calendar chip (design: the card
              asks, the list stays quiet) — the only other place they surface is
              this same card reopened on an edit, prefilled.

              ONE ROW, two equal columns (Akshil, 2026-09-03). They are one
              decision read together — "Fable, thinking high" is the
              sentence — and stacking them spent two full rows of the card's
              least-used section saying half of it each. Permissions stays on
              its own line above: it is a policy with a consequence to explain,
              and these two are a pair of names.

              Neither carries a hint any more. Model's ("Default lets the run
              use whatever this project already uses") restated what the word
              Default already says, and one hint under one of a pair of side-by-
