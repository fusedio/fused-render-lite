// "Current apps" — the sidebar section above Bookmarks (D487, redesigned
// 2026-08-26): the apps on the user's desk, read from a STORE of their own
// (`GET /api/current-apps`, fused_render/current_apps.py) — every kind of app,
// workspace or linked. A row opens the app's PAGE (`/apps/<folder>`,
// shell/AppPage.tsx, D488) — the one door that page has; its cross REMOVES the
// app from the desk and, as the side effect, archives every task under it.
//
// The desk is NOT the task list. A new task puts its app on the desk; nothing
// takes it off but the cross. So this section fetches the table itself, and
// re-fetches when the task pulse shows a task key it has not seen — the only
// event that can add a row. The pulse is still read for one thing: the running
// dot. That is a subscription this sidebar already holds, not a second poll.
//
// The ORDER is a sequence per app, not the added order it is seeded from
// (current-apps-lib.ts): a row moves only when the user drags it, so new work
// does not reshuffle the list under the cursor. The store is the module-level
// `appOrder` below, hydrated from localStorage at import and written back BY A
// DRAG AND ONLY BY A DRAG, so an arrangement survives a reload and the next
// launch without a fetch ever having an opinion about it.
