// THE FLOATING COLUMN IS ONE SHARED WIDTH, read off the stylesheet.
//
// User: "why are some notification cards significantly wider than others? I
// want all of them to have the same width." The bug was never in any one
// card's own markup — `.notif-host` only ever set a `max-width` (a ceiling),
// paired with `align-items: flex-end` (which shrink-wraps each child to its
// own content underneath that ceiling), so a short caption sat at `.dl-row`'s
// 238px floor while a long title stretched toward the (then-)360px ceiling and
// the stack read as a ragged pile. The ceiling was later narrowed to 300px
// (user: "reduce the card width for notifications. it is too wide"), which
// does not change any of the reasoning below — a `max-width` is still only a
// ceiling regardless of its number.
//
// A stylesheet test rather than a computed-style one, the same reasoning
// `apps/claude/styles/refusal.test.ts` and `parity.test.ts` already argue at
// length: this suite runs under `react-test-renderer` with no CSSOM, so
// `getComputedStyle` has nothing to answer with, and the regression itself
// lived entirely in the stylesheet's own numbers, not in any component's
// markup. The visual half — a very short caption and a very long clamped
// title producing the same card width — is checked by eye in the browser.
