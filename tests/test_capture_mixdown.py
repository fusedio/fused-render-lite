"""The `audio: "both"` mixdown — the pure half, tested off a Mac.

`capture/_mixdown.py` deliberately imports nothing from Apple so that the part
of the macOS 13–14 recorder with actual ARITHMETIC in it can be tested on every
runner. What cannot be tested here is the sample buffers arriving — that lives in
`_darwin_mux` and needs a display, a microphone and an OS two versions behind
this one.

The claim these tests are really defending is the one in the module docstring:
drop/insert does not merely tolerate clock drift, it BOUNDS it. A ring that grew
would be a recording drifting further out of sync every minute, which is what
"some drift is acceptable" must not be allowed to mean.
