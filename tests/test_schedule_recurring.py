"""Recurring schedules — templates, materialization, and skip-not-catch-up.

The model under test is the occurrence-as-entry design: a `recurring` template
is never sent itself; `_materialize` keeps exactly one pending one-shot
occurrence ahead of it, and that occurrence flows through the ordinary firing
machinery. Spawns and the wake stub are stubbed exactly as in test_schedule.py.

# `session_learned` is the provenance of `session_id`, and it exists because two
# unlike things write that field: a chat handoff (the conversation the user was
# in when they scheduled the task) and a thread the template LEARNED on its
# first run. An edit is cancel + re-create, and it must refuse the first while
# keeping the second — so the form used to guess, counting an id as learned only
# if the entry already repeated. That guess dies on a round trip: demote a
# chaining task to a one-off (the learned id rides along on purpose), promote it
# back, and its own thread reads as a chat handoff and is dropped (Bugbot,
# PR #555). Only the moment the id is written knows the answer, so that moment
# records it.
