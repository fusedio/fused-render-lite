"""Tests for fused_render_app/claude_login.py and the three sign-in endpoints.

Like test_claude_install, this module RUNS THINGS — so the assertions cluster
around what it will not do, and around the two properties that are wrong
invisibly: that a failed sign-in keeps the child's own diagnosis, and that
nothing the child printed is ever written down.

Nothing below signs anything in. `subprocess.Popen` is faked at the module
boundary, so what is under test is the state machine, the guards and the output
discipline — not the OAuth flow.
