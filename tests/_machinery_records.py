"""Real `type: user` records that a human did not type, for the four readers
that have to agree about them.

Every string here is a trimmed copy of something found in a real
`~/.claude/projects` transcript on 2026-08-17 — the JSON payloads are shortened,
the wording and the block structure are not. That matters more than usual: the
bug these fixtures exist for was a reader that dropped `<live-app-state>` as
machinery when the block is actually a PREFIX the fused-render Claude page puts
in front of what the user typed, and a toy string like `"<live-app-state>x"`
cannot tell the two apart. Neither can it catch the `/model` envelope, whose
sibling blocks arrive INDENTED, or the annotation preamble, which has no tag at
all and is recognised only by its opening sentence and its json fence.

Shared by tests/test_tasks_store.py, tests/test_tasks_api.py,
tests/test_claude_session_summaries.py and tests/test_claude_sessions_merged.py
so no reader can be pinned against a friendlier corpus than its siblings.
