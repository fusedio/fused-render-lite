"""The appearance theme reaches every rendered page (docs/BOT-APP.md §5).

The shell's pre-paint bootstrap (frontend/bots.html, frontend/lite.html) and
the runtime injected into every /render and /embed page (static/runtime.js)
must agree on the localStorage key and the attribute, or a built app that
opts in with `data-fused-theme` stays dark while the shell is light — the
gap a bot's own build reported live ("the runtime ignores the theme
attribute"). These pins keep the spellings together.
