"""Tests for fused_render_app/claude_health.py and GET /api/claude/health.

The point of this module is to say something TRUE about the machine before
anything needs Claude Code, so the tests are mostly about the ways a health
report can lie: claiming an install is too old when the version could not be
read, claiming a macOS user is signed out because a file is missing, serving a
cached answer after the binary changed underneath it.

No test runs a real `claude`: resolution is driven through a fake tree plus a
patched PATH, and the version probe's one subprocess hop is patched at the
module boundary (the same discipline as test_server_ai.py).
