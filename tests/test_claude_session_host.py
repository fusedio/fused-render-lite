"""session_host.py: one long-lived process owns the CLI's stdin for a whole
chat session, not just one turn.

`_start` now detaches `session_host.py` instead of the CLAUDE CLI directly.
This drives the REAL host against a small stub `claude` binary (a Python
script standing in for the CLI, wired in via FUSED_RENDER_CLAUDE_BIN) —
nothing here is mocked at the Popen level, because the whole point of this
task is the process tree `_start` now actually spawns.

The stub speaks a tiny protocol over stream-json: each line it reads is
echoed back as `{"type": "echo", "text": <the user text>}`, immediately
followed by a `result` row — except two magic strings, `BGON`/`BGOFF`, which
also emit a `background_tasks_changed` row (non-empty / empty) so the reap
timer's "tasks_pending holds the reap off" branch can be exercised without
a real background task ever running.
