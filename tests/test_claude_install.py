"""Tests for fused_render_app/claude_install.py and the three repair endpoints.

This module RUNS THINGS, which is what separates it from claude_health: a wrong
answer there is bad advice, a wrong answer here spawns a process that writes an
executable into the user's home. So the assertions cluster around the refusals —
what it will not do, and whether it says why in words the strip can show.

Nothing below spawns a real installer. `subprocess.Popen` is faked at the module
boundary and the health re-probe is stubbed, so what is under test is the state
machine and the guards, not the network.
