"""Writes a fake `claude` CLI binary that the session-host tests can launch.

Shared by test_claude_session_host.py, test_claude_send_action.py and
test_claude_control_requests.py — each defines its own stub protocol (a
`_STUB.format(python=...)` script body) but needs the same thing done with it:
a file that `subprocess.Popen([path, ...])` can actually launch, handed back
as the string those tests point FUSED_RENDER_CLAUDE_BIN at.

POSIX launches an extensionless file with a `#!<python>` shebang directly, so
the body is written as-is and given the execute bit. Windows has neither
shebang handling nor an execute bit: CreateProcess cannot run an extensionless
file at all, so the body goes into a sibling `.py` file and `path` instead
names a `.bat` that invokes `sys.executable` on it — `subprocess.Popen`
launches a `.bat` directly on Windows (CreateProcess special-cases `.bat`/
`.cmd` through `cmd.exe` even without `shell=True`), and the interpreter that
runs the `.py` is the same one running the tests, matching the POSIX shebang.

    that a test's `agent._start` left running under `run_dir`.

    The host is spawned `start_new_session` on purpose so a real chat
    survives a server restart, which means nothing reaps it when the test
    process exits: pytest's tmp_path is rmtree'd, and the host and stub stay
    up until reboot. A stub that never closes its turn (no `result` row, or
    a `control_response` row after the `result`, which agent._turn_state
    reads as the turn reopening) also defeats the host's own idle reap, so
    every test that starts a real host must call this in teardown.

    Both pids are session leaders (agent._DETACH), so each pid is its own
    process group: `killpg` on the host's pid takes the host, `killpg` on the
    CLI's pid takes the stub and whatever it forked. Waits up to `timeout`
    for the host to have written its pid files first, so a test that ends
