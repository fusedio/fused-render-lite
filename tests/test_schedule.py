"""Scheduled Claude messages — the model (fused_render/schedule.py).

The store, the firing decision, and the two rules that make "the app owns the
send" survivable: wall-clock comparison (so a due time that passed while the app
was closed still fires) and a bound on how late that is still worth doing.

Nothing here spawns a real claude: the send is stubbed at claude_spawn's
`spawn_helper` seam, and the wake stub is stubbed everywhere so no test writes a
LaunchAgent on a developer's own macOS machine.
