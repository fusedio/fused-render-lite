"""The ``.fused`` v2 physical format: an opaque container, not an archive.

v1 (D385) was a zip with its extension renamed. Mail scanners classify an
attachment by its BYTES, not its name: Gmail saw ``PK``, walked the members,
found an ``.html`` and a ``.py`` in a script-shaped bundle, and flagged the
file as suspicious — the rename bought nothing. v2 is a format nothing
classifies as an archive: a fixed magic, a versioned header, a deflated JSON
index and per-file deflate streams. To a scanner it is an unknown binary,
the same class ``.sqlite`` or ``.blend`` attachments fall in.

Layout (all integers little-endian)::

    0   8 bytes  magic          b"FUSEDAPP"
    8   u16      version        2
    10  u16      flags          0 (reserved)
    12  u32      index_size     decompressed index length
    16  u32      index_csize    compressed index length
    20  ...      index          zlib(JSON), ``index_csize`` bytes
    20+index_csize  ...         data section: one zlib stream per file

The index carries what v1's ``manifest.json`` did (``fused_app_file: 2``,
``name``, ``entry``) plus ``files``: a list of ``{path, offset, size, csize,
sha256}`` where ``offset`` is relative to the START OF THE DATA SECTION, so
the writer can stream every file into a temp before it knows the index's own
compressed length. ``sha256`` is of the decompressed bytes and is verified on
extract.

Reading is as hardened as ``zip_import`` is for zips, because a ``.fused``
that arrived by mail is exactly as untrusted as an uploaded template pack —
and every declared number in the header and index is attacker-controlled:

* the index is capped BEFORE decompression (declared size AND the bytes a
  bounded ``decompressobj`` actually yields), so a crafted header cannot
  become a memory bomb;
* every ``path`` must be relative, forward-slash, free of ``\\``, empty
  segments, ``.`` and ``..``, unique, and never both a file and a directory
  of another file (``a`` and ``a/b``) — checked for the whole index before
  any byte lands, so a rejected file leaves nothing behind;
* per-entry and total caps are enforced on bytes actually WRITTEN, not on the
  declared sizes; a stream that yields more than it declared, or fewer bytes,
  or the wrong hash, rejects the whole extract.

This module knows nothing about apps, markers or the cache layout — that is
``appfile.py``'s job; this is the codec plus the safe extractor.
