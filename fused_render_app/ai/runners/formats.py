"""What each backend's WEIGHTS look like on disk, written once (SPEC §40).

A repo belongs to a BACKEND, not to a capability — three mutually unloadable
formats of Whisper are the standing proof, and `catalog.py` is keyed by runner
for the same reason. Every runner therefore checks the format by NAME before it
imports anything, so that a repo in the wrong shape produces a sentence naming
the format you have and the format this runner needs, rather than whatever
`FileNotFoundError` the library happens to raise.

Those checks used to be a constant apiece inside each `worker.py`. This module
is where they live now, because a SECOND reader appeared: the AI Models page
puts an engine tag on every cached repo, and the one thing that tag must never
do is promise a load the runner then refuses. Two copies of "what a CTranslate2
repo looks like" is exactly how that promise breaks.

**Stdlib only, and no import of `fused_render_app`.** It is imported by every
runner's own interpreter — which is a separate venv with the app's package
deliberately not on its path (see `supervisor._child_env`) — through the same
`sys.path` insert that reaches `worker_base`. The server reaches it as
`fused_render_app.ai.runners.formats`. Both readings must work, so nothing here may
import anything either side does not already have.

Runner CODES appear here as bare strings rather than as an import from
`registry`, for that same reason. `test_ai_formats.py` asserts every code this
module names is a registered runner, which is the drift this would otherwise
invite.

#: CTranslate2 writes one `model.bin` beside a plain-JSON config. Checked by
#: name because the loader's own failure is `Unable to open file 'model.bin'`,
#: which does not tell a user their download was the wrong FORMAT.
CT2_WEIGHTS = "model.bin"

#: An MLX conversion of Whisper, in the two spellings that are DISTINCT — no
#: other format on the Hub calls a file `weights.npz` or `weights.safetensors`,
#: so either name alone settles it. `mlx_whisper.load_models` itself looks for
#: `model.safetensors` first, then these two — but `model.safetensors` is the
#: filename every transformers repo carries, so that third spelling is only
#: evidence TOGETHER with a whisper-shaped config (see
#: `is_mlx_whisper_snapshot`). mlx-community publishes all three: `weights.npz`
#: on most conversions, `weights.safetensors` on the large-v3-turbo era, and
#: `model.safetensors` on the newer quantized re-uploads (whisper-tiny.en-8bit).
MLX_WHISPER_WEIGHTS = ("weights.npz", "weights.safetensors")

#: …and the third spelling, shared with every transformers repo on the Hub.
MLX_WHISPER_SHARED_WEIGHTS = "model.safetensors"

#: What an MLX whisper `config.json` is: the OpenAI `ModelDimensions` fields,
#: verbatim. A transformers Whisper config spells the same facts as
#: `num_mel_bins`/`d_model`/`encoder_layers` and a NeMo config has `target`, so
#: these keys appear together nowhere else. Two are required rather than one so
#: a stray `n_vocab` in some other config cannot claim a repo alone.
MLX_WHISPER_CONFIG_KEYS = ("n_mels", "n_audio_ctx", "n_vocab")

#: An MLX conversion of a NeMo Parakeet model — the single file the withdrawn
#: `parakeet-mlx` runner used to load (D406). Nothing distinguishing on its
#: own: it is the name every transformers repo on the Hub carries, which is
#: exactly why the config below has to be read too. Still checked so a
#: Parakeet snapshot is recognised as unloadable rather than mistaken for a
#: text checkpoint — see `is_parakeet_checkpoint` and the early return in
#: `loaders()`.
PARAKEET_WEIGHTS = "model.safetensors"

#: …and what DOES distinguish one. A Parakeet snapshot's `config.json` is
#: NeMo's training config, not a transformers one, and it names the class the
#: weights came out of in `target` — which is what `parakeet_mlx.from_config`
#: dispatched on before the runner was withdrawn (D406). The prefix is
#: narrowed to `…asr.models.` deliberately: NeMo also ships TTS and LLM
#: collections that no runner here loads either, so a check on the word
#: "nemo" would offer a Load button for a speech SYNTHESIS repo and fail
#: inside a library that never had a chance.
NEMO_ASR_TARGET = "nemo.collections.asr.models."

#: What an mflux-readable snapshot always has: component subfolders of MLX
#: safetensors, rather than the single-file layout diffusers writes.
MFLUX_COMPONENTS = ("transformer", "text_encoder", "vae")

#: What a MiniMax-H3 snapshot always has at its ROOT: the `FL2VA/`
#: checkpoint tree. **No runner reads this layout any more** — D468 dropped
#: `h3-video` — but the signal is still load-bearing, for the same reason
#: D406's withdrawn Parakeet runner left its own check standing: the real
#: repo (`MiniMaxAI/MiniMax-H3`) ALSO carries a root-level
#: `model_index.json` — h3.c's own bookkeeping file, not a diffusers
#: pipeline manifest — so this check has to run, and RETURN, before the
#: `DIFFUSERS_INDEX` check below, or a snapshot somebody already fetched
#: would be mislabelled as a diffusers-loadable repo and the page would
#: offer a Load button that opens on a layout diffusers cannot read.
H3_COMPONENT = "FL2VA"

#: `dgrauet/ltx-2.3-mlx-q4`'s own manifest file (mlx-forge's split-conversion
#: bookkeeping, not something any pipeline reads) — VERIFIED present at the
#: root of both curated LTX-2.3 repos (2026-08-23) beside the transformer
#: files `has_ltx_split_layout` also checks for. Paired with a
#: `transformer-*` safetensors name rather than trusted alone: a directory of
#: safetensors otherwise says nothing about the modality (this file's own
#: rule for why `mlx-text` is not in `DECISIVE`), and a manifest name alone
#: is a thinner claim than this codebase usually accepts for "this repo IS a
#: specific thing" — see `is_mlx_whisper_snapshot`'s own two-signal shape for
#: the same argument made about a different format.
LTX_SPLIT_MANIFEST = "split_model.json"

#: Repo id -> the mflux VARIANT class that loads it and the model config that
#: describes it. mflux has no `AutoPipeline`, and the variant and its config are
#: two arguments nothing can guess, so an unknown repo is refused with a
#: sentence rather than attempted.
#:
#: Here rather than in the worker because it is the OTHER half of "can mflux
#: load this": the components can be perfect and the repo still unbuildable,
#: and a card that showed the engine off the layout alone would offer a Load
#: for every MLX diffusion repo on the Hub.
#:
#: `vae` names the AUTOENCODER the conversion was made from, which is the key
#: `preview.PROJECTIONS` is indexed by. It is a class name out of diffusers and
#: mflux has no such class, so it can look like a stray fact in an MLX table —
#: it is not. The two image runners have to reach ONE row of ONE projection
#: table (a page must not be able to tell which engine rendered for it), the
#: torch one reads it off `type(pipe.vae).__name__`, and this side has no
#: equivalent to read: an mflux conversion carries the same latent space as the
#: repo it was converted from, and only this table knows which repo that was.
#: Verified rather than assumed — `bn.running_mean`/`running_var` are
#: bit-identical between the two repos (max|diff| = 0.0). A variant with no
#: `vae` simply gets no preview.
#: **Two klein sizes over ONE variant class, which is what the `config` field
#: is for.** `Flux2Klein` takes its `ModelConfig` as an argument and only
#: DEFAULTS to `flux2_klein_4b` when given none (read out of mflux 0.19.0's
#: `flux2_klein.py`), and mflux's own `AVAILABLE_MODELS` carries
#: `flux2-klein-9b` beside `flux2-klein-4b`, with the transformer and
#: text-encoder overrides that describe the bigger checkpoint. So a second
#: klein needs a row here and nothing else — no new class, no import path to
#: get right, and no second `vae` key either: the two conversions' `vae/`
#: index files list the same 266 tensor names, so they share one latent space
#: and one `preview.PROJECTIONS` row.

#: 0.19.0 on Apple Silicon — so the two are unrelated classes over the same

#: pairs without one of them reading as an override of the other, which it is
#: not. The module path is a full dotted submodule,
#: `mflux.models.flux2.variants.edit.flux2_klein_edit`, one level deeper than
#: the plain row's package — do not derive it from the plain row's by string
#: surgery, since nothing about the nesting is guaranteed to hold for a
#: future model.
#:
#: **`config` and `vae` are deliberately ABSENT here, not repeated.** They are
#: facts about the CHECKPOINT — the model config method and the autoencoder
#: the conversion carries — and editing changes only which class denoises it,
#: never which weights or which latent space it denoises. Copying them into a
#: second row would let the two rows disagree after a future edit to one of

#: of a caption's 64. These are what make RAG, document search and clustering
#: possible at all — a SigLIP text tower truncates at 64 tokens, so no chunk size
#: makes it a paragraph encoder.
#:
#: **Four families, and the boundary is "does this `model_type` distinguish an
#: encoder from a generative model".** `bert`, `xlm-roberta`, `nomic_bert` and
#: `modernbert` are encoder-only architectures: nothing generative wears those
#: strings, so the field is real evidence. Deliberately ABSENT are `qwen3`,
#: `gemma3_text`, `lfm2` and the rest of the decoder-derived embedding ports —
#: `mlx-embeddings` genuinely ships modules for several of them, but their
#: `model_type` is the CHAT architecture's, so admitting them here would route
#: every Qwen3 chat checkpoint on the disk to the embedding runner. That is

#: distinguish is not evidence.

#: The gate `loaders()` actually asks — "is this an embedding checkpoint at all"
#: — which is one question with one answer, so it is the union. The two halves
#: above are for the callers that need to know WHICH kind, and there are exactly
#: two: the `paths` refusal at the route, and this file's own MLX subset.
EMBED_MODEL_TYPES = DUAL_EMBED_MODEL_TYPES | TEXT_EMBED_MODEL_TYPES

#: Architecture suffixes that mean "this encoder has a TASK HEAD on it", and so
#: is not an embedding model whatever its `model_type` says.
#:
#: **The same argument as `TEXT_EMBED_MODEL_TYPES`' comment, running the other
#: way.** There the point was that `model_type` is only evidence where it
#: distinguishes an encoder from a generative model. Here it is that `model_type`
#: alone does not distinguish far enough: `BAAI/bge-reranker-base` is an
#: `xlm-roberta` and `dslim/bert-base-NER` is a `bert`, both admitted by that
#: set, and both are a fine-tuned encoder plus a head. A cross-encoder scores a
#: PAIR of texts and has no single-text vector to give; a token classifier's
#: pooled output is a by-product nothing trained. Pooling either returns a
#: confident unit vector that means nothing, and — because `loaders()` returns
#: EARLY on an embedding match — the repo never reaches another runner that might
#: have recognised it, so the AI Models page shows four Load buttons and no
#: correct one.
#:
#: `architectures` is the evidence, and it is present on every transformers
#: config that has a head, because it is what `AutoModel` dispatches on.
#:
#: `ForMaskedLM` is deliberately NOT here: that is the pretraining objective an
#: ordinary base encoder ships with (`BertForMaskedLM`, `ModernBertForMaskedLM`),
#: the head is discarded when the encoder is used for embeddings, and excluding
#: it would reject a large share of the legitimate models this gate exists to
#: admit.
#: `"Classification"` unqualified rather than the four `For*Classification`
#: spellings, because the modality is in the middle of the name and enumerating
#: them is a list to forget an entry in: `ForSequenceClassification` (rerankers),
#: `ForTokenClassification` (NER), `ForImageClassification` and
#: `ForAudioClassification` all end the same way, and a head named after a

#: it ships `siglip.py`, `bert.py`, `modernbert.py` and `xlm_roberta.py` (the
#: loader sanitizes `-` to `_` when it imports by `model_type`, which is why
#: `xlm-roberta` is spelled with the hyphen the config uses).
#:
#: Two families are therefore ONNX-ONLY here. `clip`: mlx-embeddings has no CLIP
#: port, so a CLIP checkpoint in SAFETENSORS is loadable by nothing at all — the
#: ONNX runner reads a `clip` export happily, but it reads the export and not the
#: safetensors. `nomic_bert`: same story, and it is the reason the curated
#: default is an ONNX row rather than one both engines share.
#:
#: A SUBSET of `EMBED_MODEL_TYPES`, never a superset: a family the gate does not
#: recognise can never reach the MLX check in `loaders()`, so an entry here that
#: is not in the union above would be a line nothing can read.
#:
#: Split rather than shared because this is exactly what `loaders()` answers: a
#: Mac that resolved to MLX must not be offered a Load for a checkpoint its
#: engine has no module for.

#: …and the subset the ONNX runner reads, which is the same idea as
#: `MLX_EMBED_MODEL_TYPES` and exists for the same sentence: an engine must not
#: be offered a Load for a family it has not been verified against.
#:
#: **`clip` is the one family in the gate and in NEITHER engine's set, and that
#: is deliberate.** Every constant in `runners/onnx_embed.py` was checked against
#: SigLIP2 exports and nothing else, and CLIP differs in two ways that each
#: produce a confident wrong answer rather than an error:
#:
#: * a CLIP export publishes PROJECTED `text_embeds` / `image_embeds`, so
#:   `_output_index(session, "pooler_output", ...)` either raises or reads the
#:   unprojected pooled state — which leaves the two towers in different spaces,
#:   and a cosine across them is meaningless while still looking like a number
#:   between -1 and 1;
#: * `_image_settings` ignores `crop_size` and `do_center_crop`, and CLIP
#:   RESIZES THEN CENTER-CROPS where SigLIP resizes outright, so pixels reach the
#:   vision tower framed differently from training.
#:
#: To re-admit it: get a real CLIP export into the loop, confirm which outputs
#: its graphs actually declare and read the projected pair, and take the
#: resize-then-crop geometry off `preprocessor_config.json`. Until someone has
#: run that, this module's own standard applies — constants come off the config,
#: not off an assumption.
#:
#: It stays in `DUAL_EMBED_MODEL_TYPES` all the same, and removing it from there
#: would be the wrong fix: the gate is what makes `loaders()` return EARLY, and
#: without that a CLIP snapshot falls through to the text branch and is offered
#: as a CHAT model — a worse answer than "nothing here loads this", and one an
#: existing test already pins.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Picking ONE GGUF file out of an arbitrary repo's own listing (D412).
#
# `GGUF_RECIPES` above is 5 keys over 3 repos — a hand-curated shortcut, not
# a limit llama.cpp itself imposes. Any Hub repo that carries a root-level
# GGUF is loadable by `llama_cpp.Llama`; the only reason an uncurated one was
# previously refused is that this app had no rule for choosing WHICH of a
# repo's 20-30 quantizations a bare repo id should mean. This section is that
# rule, used by both `llama_text._resolve_model_id` (worker side, an
# uncurated repo id) and `hub_models.py`'s search (page side, deciding
# whether a GGUF search result is actionable) — the same "one answer, two
# readers" shape `GGUF_RECIPES` itself states above, and for the identical
# reason: the two must not be able to disagree about which file a repo id
# means.
#
# **Deterministic, not hardware-aware, and that is a considered choice, not
# an oversight.** A model id has to determine the same bytes on a 6GB laptop
# and a 24GB desktop — `catalog.SUGGESTIONS["llamacpp-text"]`'s own
# `size_gb` field is a promise that breaks the moment resolution varies by
# machine, and `ai_runtime.py`'s downloaded/curated join keys entries by
# FILENAME for the same reason. A hardware BUDGET was considered and
# rejected on a harder ground than non-determinism: there is nothing to
# budget against. `llama_cpp.py`'s ctypes bindings expose no
# `ggml_backend_dev_memory` or any other free-VRAM query (confirmed by
# reading the installed bindings — see `llama_text.py`'s own "sized by
# trying, not calculating" note), so a "budget" would be total system RAM or
# a guess, not a measurement. What makes hardware-blindness AFFORDABLE rather
# than reckless is `llama_text._offload_schedule`: an over-large pick
# degrades to partial or full CPU offload instead of failing, so the cost of
# picking too big is a slower load, never a crash — the one cost backoff
# cannot undo is the DOWNLOAD itself, which is exactly why the suffix
# priority below starts at Q4_K_M rather than at the true smallest quant a
# repo might publish.
#
# **The exclusion rules were measured, not assumed.** Split shards and
# subdirectories were checked against five real repos (`unsloth/Qwen3.5-9B-GGUF`,
# `unsloth/Qwen3.8-27B-GGUF`, `unsloth/Qwen3-Coder-30B-A3B-Instruct-GGUF`,
# `bartowski/Qwen_Qwen3-8B-GGUF`, `ornith-ai/Ornith-1.0-9B-GGUF`) on
# 2026-08-21; the auxiliary-filename list was widened past that single pass —
# an initial guess of `mmproj` / `mtp-` / `draft` (from ONE observed file,
# `MTP/mtp-Qwen3.8-27B-Q4_0.gguf`) was re-checked against ~200 real
# `text-generation` + `gguf`-tagged repos (2637 GGUF filenames) before being
# trusted: `mmproj` and `draft` held as plain substrings, `mtp-` was WRONG as
# an anchored pattern (`RVN-Q4_K_M-mtp.gguf` — the dash comes BEFORE "mtp",
# not after, in the common suffix form) and is now a bare substring too, and
# `projector` was found and added (`llama-3.2-11B-vision_f16_projector.gguf`
# — an mmproj-shaped file that never contains the string "mmproj" at all).
# `specul`/`speculative` was tried and REJECTED: it false-positive-matched a
# real fine-tune name, `DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B-GRPO-SpeculativeReasoner`,
# that is not a draft model at all. Multimodal projectors are NOT
# theoretical for a text-generation picker either — every mmproj-carrying
# repo found in that scan (`prism-ml/Bonsai-27B-gguf` and its ternary
# sibling) is tagged `pipeline_tag: text-generation`, the base LLM and its
# projector sharing one repo, so this exclusion is load-bearing on the exact
# path this picker serves, not a precaution against a shape that cannot
# occur here.

#: A GGUF this app must never offer as "the chat model", even though it is an
#: ordinary single file a naive scan would rank — auxiliary weights
#: llama.cpp's own ecosystem ships ALONGSIDE a standalone causal-LM
#: checkpoint rather than as one. Bare substrings, not anchored patterns —
#: see the section note above for why `mtp-` (anchored) missed real files an
#: unanchored `mtp` does not.

#: A multi-part GGUF shard (`-00001-of-00005.gguf`). `download()`
#: (`worker_base.download_file`) fetches exactly ONE file, so a split
#: quantization can never be assembled by this runner's existing download
#: path — excluding it from candidacy costs nothing this runner could have
#: served anyway. Observed only under a `BF16/` subdirectory in the sample
#: above, so `pick_gguf_file`'s subdirectory exclusion already catches every
#: split file seen in practice; this regex is the belt to that suspenders; in
#: case a future repo ships a split quantization at its root.

#: but this is the one list where being wrong is expensive in a way
#: `llama_text._offload_schedule`'s backoff cannot fix — a pick that is too
#: LARGE for the GPU degrades to a slower load, but a pick that is too SMALL
#: (an aggressively quantized, noticeably degraded model) downloads exactly
#: as many bytes and then answers worse, which backoff has no lever for at
#: all. `Q4_K_M` is the community's own floor for "still a reliable
#: general-purpose quant" — the branch's own curated table never suggests
#: anything below it either (its cheapest entries are Q4_K_M/Q5_K_M).
#: `Q6_K`/`Q8_0` are ranked last among NAMED suffixes because they are closer
#: to unquantized than to the sweet spot most repos are downloaded for.

#: Anchored to the literal end of the filename, so `.search()` can only
#: succeed at the one position adjacent to `.gguf`, never on an

    — or the single best-quality candidate when `budget_bytes` is None (no
    machine budget known yet) — as `(representative_filename, total_bytes)`,
    or None when nothing here qualifies or nothing fits.

    **Shard sets collapse to ONE candidate at the summed size.** A repo that
    splits `Q4_K_M` across `-00001-of-00003.gguf` / `-00002-of-00003.gguf` /
    `-00003-of-00003.gguf` is one 3-part DOWNLOAD, not three independent
    files any one of which alone would look like it fits — judging shard 1
    alone against the budget is exactly how a 3-shard model would silently
    look like it fits when the whole download does not. Every filename
    carrying the same `_quality_token` is summed into one group and reported
    under its lowest-sorting member's name (the shard set's own first part,
    or the sole file when there is no shard suffix at all).

    applies — an `mmproj` file ranking as though it were a smaller chat-model
    quant would be the same wrong offer that function already refuses to make.

    A missing size (`None`) is estimated two ways, in precedence order.
    **A PARTIALLY-known shard set** (some parts sized, some not -- code
    review) estimates the missing parts from the KNOWN parts' own average:
    shards of one quantization are near-equal size by construction, so a
    sibling's real, measured size is better evidence than a formula, and
    this needs no `params` at all. Dropping the unsized shards from the sum
    instead (this function's own bug until the fix) always UNDERCOUNTS the
    real download -- exactly backwards for a budget picker. **A FULLY-unsized
    group** falls back to `params x bytes_per_param`, sharing `fit.QUANT_
    BYTES_PER_PARAM` rather than a second, driftable copy of the same table
    (SPEC item 14's own instruction) -- imported lazily so a bare `import
    formats` (the shape a worker's interpreter loads this module in, per the
    module's own top-of-file note) never pays for `fused_render_app.ai.fit`'s
    import unless this function is actually called, which no worker path
    does. With no known size AND no `params`, the group is excluded from
    candidacy outright -- a caller-facing default of "no size, no evidence"
    rather than a silent zero that would make an unsized file look free.

#: Quantization methods NO engine in this app can read, so a repo declaring one
#: is not offered a Load button (`loaders()` below) whatever else its snapshot
#: contains. AWQ, GPTQ and compressed-tensors each need a package no runner
#: here installs; bitsandbytes is the one with a story.
#:
#: **This was a dict of refusal SENTENCES until D416, and the sentences went
#: with the runner that printed them.** `runners/torch_text.py` raised
#: "`<repo>` is an AWQ checkpoint, which needs a package this runner does not
#: ship" so that a user reading a bare `ImportError` several frames inside a
#: transformers loader could tell a wrong-format repo from a broken download.
#: With that runner removed, the only consumer left is `unloadable_quant()`,
#: which reads the KEYS — so the values were inert prose and are gone rather
#: than kept warm for a runner that may never exist. `mlx-text` is now the only
#: engine this gate protects, and it needs no per-method sentence: mlx-lm reads
#: MLX-packed or plain safetensors and nothing else, so "not one of these four"
#: is the whole of the question here.
#:
#: **The bitsandbytes entry carries a measurement that has now been asked and
#: answered twice, and the second answer is why this comment survived the
#: deletion.** It first said "needs bitsandbytes and an NVIDIA GPU — this
#: runner ships neither", which stopped being true: bitsandbytes 0.50.1 is MIT,
#: publishes wheels and no sdist for macos arm64, manylinux x86_64 and aarch64,
#: win_amd64 and win_arm64 (checked 2026-08-21, so AI-2a's wheels-only rule
#: would not have blocked it), and documents a dedicated CPU build. So the
#: question became whether 4-bit NF4 is fast enough on a CPU to be worth
#: offering, and it was MEASURED rather than argued:
#: `unsloth/Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507-unsloth-bnb-4bit` loads on
#: `device_map="cpu"` and generates correct, coherent text (219 `Linear4bit`
#: modules, no error) at half the resident memory of bf16 (4.16GB peak RSS
#: against 8.55GB) — and 3.6x SLOWER per token, 0.65 tok/s against 2.33,
#: uncontended, same prompt and same 4B base. Quantization there bought memory
#: and spent the one resource a CPU path has least of.
#:
#: **That measurement was on Apple Silicon and it explicitly asked for an x86
#: re-measurement before anyone reversed the refusal. D416 is that
#: re-measurement, and it removed the engine instead.** On Linux x86_64 (Ryzen
#: 5 9600X, Radeon RX 9060 XT), same prompt, same 128-token cap, back to back:
#: transformers managed 12.6 tok/s on the ROCm GPU and 2.7 on the CPU, while
#: llama.cpp reading a Q5_K_M GGUF of the same model managed 53.4 and 6.4 — 4.2x
#: and 2.4x, at a third of the download and a third of the peak RSS. So the open
#: question ("is quantized CPU inference on x86 worth installing bitsandbytes
#: for?") is settled in a way that makes the original framing obsolete: the
#: quantized path this app offers is GGUF through llama.cpp, which needs no
#: extra package and beats the unquantized transformers path it would have been
#: competing with. There is nothing left here to re-measure.
UNLOADABLE_QUANT = frozenset({"awq", "gptq", "bitsandbytes", "compressed-tensors"})

#: The runners whose format evidence also settles WHAT THE MODEL IS. A
#: `weights.npz` is a Whisper conversion and nothing else; a `model_index.json`
#: is a diffusion pipeline. The safetensors text runner is the opposite case — a
#: directory of safetensors says nothing about the modality — so a match there
#: never implies a capability. (It was "the two text runners" until D416 removed
#: the transformers family; one runner reads that format now, and the reason it
#: is not decisive is unchanged, because the reason was about the FORMAT.)
#:
#: `parakeet-mlx` is gone (D406) and was never added here: the branch that
#: recognises a NeMo ASR `target` claims no runner (see `loaders()`), so there
#: is no code for this tuple to list. A NeMo ASR snapshot is still decisive —
#: the config names an ASR class nothing else in this app can read — it is
#: just decisive about matching NOTHING, which the early return in `loaders()`
#: enforces directly rather than through this table.
