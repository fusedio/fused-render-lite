"""Text-to-image on mflux (MLX): one resident model, four routes (SPEC §40).

The Apple Silicon counterpart of `runners/torch_image.py`, and deliberately
its twin from the outside: the same `/generate` body, the same one-JSON reply,
the same PNG written to the path the SERVER chose, the same denoising-step
progress on the caller's job row, the same ✕. `fused.ai.image()` cannot tell
which of the two rendered for it, and that is the contract — the second image
runner must not become a second image API.

What is genuinely different is underneath:

* **One repo, already quantized.** The torch runner needs a recipe: a ~2.4GB
  Q4_K_M GGUF transformer swapped into a pipeline whose text encoder, VAE and
  tokenizer still come from the ~7.7GB bf16 base repo, because FLUX in full
  precision OOMs a 16GB machine. The `mlx-community` conversion is 4-bit
  throughout, so there is nothing to swap and nothing to skip — one snapshot,
  ~4.6GB, loaded as it is.
* **Progress comes from mflux's own callback registry**, not from a `callback_
  on_step_end=` argument. `generate_image()` takes no callback parameter; it
  calls `ctx.in_loop(t, latents)` on every denoising step, and the registry
  those callbacks live in is a public attribute of the model. So the hook is a
  registration rather than an argument — see `_StepReporter`, and note it is
  registered ONCE per model.
* **A cancel unwinds through that same callback**, which is the only
  interruption point in a minutes-long call. mflux's loop catches
  `KeyboardInterrupt` and nothing else, so a `worker_base.Cancelled` raised
  inside the hook propagates straight out of `generate_image()` — which is what
  we want, and is why the ✕ needs no orphan machinery here (unlike
  `mlx_whisper/worker.py`, whose library call has no per-step hook at all).

**Registered BELOW `diffusers-image` in the registry, so it is opt-in.** The
speed case is measured and real (D310), but it is measured on ONE 34GB machine,
and MLX's allocator reserved a ~23.6GB high-water pool there — larger than
torch's driver allocation on the same render. Nothing has been tried on a 16GB
Mac, which is exactly the machine this app's own catalog note says full-precision
FLUX already OOMs. Being available-but-not-default is what the engine picker is
for.

    **MLX default streams are per-thread from mlx 0.32 on, and this worker is
    threaded.** `load` runs on `worker_base.serve`'s bring-up thread, which then
    exits; `generate` arrives on a `ThreadingTCPServer` request thread. An
    UNEVALUATED array is a graph pinned to the stream it was built on, and
    forcing it from another thread throws
    `std::runtime_error("There is no Stream(cpu, 0) in current thread")` — see
    `load` for what that costs and `mlx_whisper/worker.py::_pin_stream` for the
    same mechanism written out at length.

    **`mx.cpu` as well as the default device, which is where a verbatim copy of
    the whisper runner's version would have been wrong.** The default stream is
    per (thread, DEVICE): `set_default_stream` is documented to replace the
    default "for the stream's device", so pinning `default_device()` alone — the
    GPU — leaves this thread's CPU default exactly where it was. Measured on
    0.32.1: a gpu-only pin on both threads does not fix this runner, it only
    moves the index in the abort (`There is no Stream(cpu, 2)`), while the
    cpu pin alone renders. Both are pinned anyway, because which device holds
    the next version's lazy graph is not something to re-measure per release.

    Pinning a CPU stream does NOT move the default DEVICE — measured:
    `mx.default_device()` is still `Device(gpu, 0)` after a render, and the
    render's own speed is unchanged.

    `new_thread_unsafe_stream` is mlx's own answer: a stream not owned by the
    thread that made it. **The sharing is the mechanism** — one stream per
    device for the whole process, so a graph built on any thread is forceable on
    any other. "Unsafe" means it must not be driven by two threads AT ONCE,
    which this worker already guarantees: `worker_base.GENERATE_LOCK` serializes
    renders and the load completes before the server accepts a request.

    A no-op on an mlx too old to have the call, which is the right answer:

    # no Python traceback. See `_pin_stream` above, and the whisper runner's for
    # the mechanism in full.

    # **The array that actually kills it, because the old note named the wrong
    # one.** That note claimed "every array in the model arrives through
    # `WeightLoader` -> `mx.load(...)`, which returns materialised safetensors
    # data rather than a graph". `mx.load` does no such thing: it returns a LAZY
    # graph whose single node is MLX's `Load` primitive, and `Load` is scheduled
    # on the CPU stream whatever the default device is. mflux 0.19's FLUX.2 path
    # never forces it — `WeightLoader._try_load_mflux_format` reads the shards,
    # `WeightApplier.apply_and_quantize` installs them with `model.update(...)`
    # and `nn.quantize(...)`, and `flux2_initializer.py` has no `mx.eval` at all
    # (unlike the krea2 and ideogram4 initializers, which do). So the
    # transformer, text encoder and VAE weights reach the request thread as live
    # `Load` graphs owned by the BRING-UP thread's cpu stream. Whisper's leak was
    # two derived tensors `parameters()` could not see; this one is the weights
    # themselves.

    # same hazard, so treat this as 0.32.x):**
    #   * Unfixed, this exact code — `load` on a thread that then exits, then
    #     `generate` on a second thread, 2 steps at 256x256 — dies at mflux's
    #     per-step `mx.eval(latents)` (`flux2_klein.generate_image`) with
    #     `There is no Stream(cpu, 0) in current thread`. That is the
    #     supervisor's dropped connection and the page's "the image process did
    #     not answer".
    #   * `mx.default_stream(...)` on 0.32.1 reports `Stream(cpu, 0)` and
    #     `Stream(gpu, 1)` on the first thread to touch MLX, 2/3 on the next and
    #     4/5 on the one after — the default stream is per (thread, DEVICE).
    #   * Pinning `default_device()` alone, on BOTH threads, does not fix it:
    #     the same run dies with `There is no Stream(cpu, 2)`. Pinning cpu alone
    #     renders. Both are pinned; see `_pin_stream`.
    #   * With `_pin_stream` on both threads the same run returns a 256x256 PNG
    #     and `mx.default_device()` is still `Device(gpu, 0)`. Both timings below
    #     are `generate`'s OWN clock — the render, with the model already loaded
    #     and the load excluded: ~8.5s for the FIRST render after a load (its
    #     first step alone is ~6s, Metal compiling kernels), ~3.3-3.4s for every
    #     warm render after that. Compare like for like when re-running: the
    #     first number is not reproducible twice in one process.
    #   * A different configuration, for scale rather than comparison: the same
    #     fix driven end-to-end through the server at 512x512 / 4 steps, warm HF
    #     cache, produced a 512x512 RGB PNG with per-step times 8.09s, 6.09s,
    #     5.50s, 5.78s and ~51s of total wall clock INCLUDING the model load —
    #     and no `libc++abi` or `Stream(cpu` line in the worker log.
    #
    # **Whether the LIVE PREVIEW is on changes only how the failure looks, not
    # whether it happens.** mflux calls `ctx.in_loop(t, latents)` one line BEFORE
    # its own `mx.eval(latents)`, so with a preview sink attached `_as_numpy`
    # forces the graph first, across numpy's `__array__` boundary — which is

    # `except Exception` cannot see it by construction. With no sink, mflux's own

    # `RuntimeError`. The fix is the pin; the preview is not the problem.

    Decision 3: residency is keyed by `(model_id, mode)`. This is a

    model at bring-up) — there is no second worker to route an edit request
    to, so the swap happens in place, lazily, only when a request's mode
    actually differs from the one already resident. A run of ordinary
    generates after an edit (or vice versa) swaps back the same way; neither
    direction touches the network, since `_build_variant` never re-downloads.

    Plain generate is UNAFFECTED by this function's existence: a caller who
    never passes `image` always finds `_loaded["mode"] == "generate"` already
    (`load()` sets it), so this returns on its first line and the resident
    `Flux2Klein` object built at load time is untouched for the life of the
    process — Decision 3's "zero behaviour change" in code.

    **Validated before anything is dropped.** A model with no row in the
    table `mode` needs must leave the worker exactly as resident as it found
    it — a request that turns out to be refused is not licence to break the
    NEXT one — so `_recipe_for` is checked first and `_build_variant` is
    called for its lookup+raise (never returning) before `_loaded["model"]`
    is touched at all.

    **The OLD model's reference is dropped before the NEW one is built, not
    after.** `_build_variant` constructs a full second model object — every
    weight tensor of it — before this function ever assigns the result
    anywhere; holding `_loaded["model"]` pointed at the outgoing variant for
    that whole build means this process holds BOTH resident at once, which
    on the 16GB Macs this runner targets is the difference between a
    working swap and an OOM mid-request. Dropping the reference first lets
    the interpreter (and mflux's own allocator, once nothing holds the
    arrays) reclaim the old weights before the new ones are asked for.

    **`job`, so the swap is not invisible on the row.** A full rebuild
    measured ~0.6s warm on the hardware that ran Gate B, and worse cold or
    on a smaller Mac — with no tick here, `snapshot()["state"]` would still
    read `"ready"` for the whole of it, no detail and no progress, which is
    exactly the "user watches a stalled render" failure the mode-keyed swap
    exists to keep from happening anywhere ELSE (see the module docstring's
    note on why a swap must not re-download). `None` is fine when nothing
    is watching (a bring-up thread's own first `load()` never swaps, so
