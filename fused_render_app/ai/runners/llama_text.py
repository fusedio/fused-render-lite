"""Text generation on llama.cpp / GGUF: one resident model, four routes (SPEC §40).

**This module is the whole of the runner and it sits at the runners ROOT**,
beside `worker_base.py`, `formats.py` and `torch_image.py`: TWO folders serve
this one engine — `llamacpp_text/` and `llamacpp_text_vulkan/` — and each holds
only a `pyproject.toml` and a five-line `worker.py` shell around `main()`
below. They differ in which wheel index their manifest takes
`llama-cpp-python` from, and the hardware that names is a fact about the wheel,
never about the code. (The pattern is `torch_image.py`'s and was the removed
`torch_text.py`'s, which served three such folders — D416.)

**The DEFAULT text engine on Windows and Linux since D416, and now only the
FALLTHROUGH one wherever `llamacpp_text_vulkan/`'s own row can run — and it
was designed not to be even that.** This module shipped registered below
three `transformers-text*` rows so that `auto` could never reach it, because
`llamacpp_text/pyproject.toml` records that the maintainer's wheel index is a
coin-flip per release on macOS arm64 (4 of 16 sampled releases fail an
integrity check) and a capability that fragile to INSTALL is a poor thing to
hand a machine that did not ask for it. D416 removed those rows on a
benchmark this engine won on every axis at once (4.2x transformers'
throughput on a Radeon GPU, 2.4x on CPU, a third of the download, a third of
the peak RSS), so the packaging argument lost to a performance one and the
default moved here. The GPU-first policy decision (`registry.py`'s block
comment above `_RUNNERS`) has since moved it again, onto
`llamacpp_text_vulkan/`'s row, wherever `registry._vulkan` finds a usable
hardware Vulkan GPU — this module still backs BOTH rows (`main()` below is
shared), so what changed is which folder's wheel a Windows/Linux machine
gets by default, not which code runs once it has one. What kept the D416
move affordable, and still applies to this row now that it is the
fallthrough: the pinned `0.3.29` Linux and Windows wheels were verified
intact, macOS arm64 still resolves to `mlx-text` ahead of this row, and a
corrupt wheel fails LOUDLY at `uv sync` rather than answering wrongly later.
`llamacpp_text/pyproject.toml` carries the version this was audited against
and the audit itself; bumping the pin without repeating it is the one thing
that folder's comment forbids.

**The model-id problem, and why there is no `repo:Q4_K_M` grammar.** A GGUF
repo commonly publishes 25-30 quantizations of one model — `unsloth/Qwen3.5-9B-GGUF`
alone is 147.81GB across every file it holds — so a MODEL here is really a
`(repo, filename)` pair, while the rest of this app addresses a model by one
string id. Inventing an id syntax to encode that pair would touch every page,
preference and cache tag that currently treats a model id as a Hub repo id
verbatim. `formats.GGUF_RECIPES` solves it the way `torch_image._GGUF_RECIPES`
solves the same shape of problem for FLUX's quantized transformer: the id is
an opaque, curated key (here, simply the GGUF's own filename — already
unique, already meaningful to a reader, and never parsed for structure)
mapped to the `(repo, file)` it actually downloads.

**The table lives in `formats.py`, not here — a second reader needs it.** The
AI Models page enumerates the local Hub cache by REPO id (that is what a
`models--org--repo` folder is keyed by), so a repo this runner already
downloaded through one of its curated ids is discoverable and offered a Load
button under its BARE REPO ID, never under the filename this table's own
entries are keyed by. Both the page (deciding whether a curated entry is
already "downloaded", and refusing to show it a second time as an
undifferentiated cached row) and this worker (resolving a repo id BACK to the
one recipe that fetched it, `_resolve_model_id` below) need the same mapping,
and the page runs in a process that cannot import this venv — the identical
reason `formats.COMPONENT_REPOS` lives there rather than inside the runner
that reads it.

**No longer true as of D412: a bare repo id `formats.GGUF_RECIPES` has never
heard of now resolves too**, through `_resolve_uncurated_repo` — the id still
supplies no filename, but this runner now HAS a rule for picking one out of
thirty (`formats.pick_gguf_file`, ranked by quantization suffix, small and
reliable first), rather than no rule at all. `GGUF_RECIPES` keeps its
original job — a hand-picked, `size_gb`-promised suggestion list, not the
only thing this engine can load — and `hub_models.py`'s search runs the SAME
picker over a result's own `siblings` before ever offering it, so a repo
that would load here is also one Hub search will surface (`Runner.hub_filter_tags`,
`registry.py`). `formats.COMPONENT_REPOS`'s repos remain the one thing this
paragraph used to describe that is STILL true of a different table: they
name a component swapped into an otherwise ordinary pipeline, not a whole
model a bare id could mean, so no picker generalizes them the way this one
generalizes `GGUF_RECIPES`.

**No external tokenizer/config download, and the reason is the FORMAT rather
than the repos.** The vocabulary, the architecture and (since llama.cpp's
chat template support landed) the chat template all live inside the ONE
file's own key-value metadata, which is exactly what `llama_cpp.Llama` reads
at load time into `.metadata`. So `download()` fetches exactly one file
(`worker_base.download_file`) and nothing else — there is no
`download_snapshot(..., allow_patterns=…)` call here, because a GGUF needs no
companion.

**This used to be argued the other way round — "those repos happen to ship
nothing but GGUFs" — and that argument expired.** It was true of the three
unsloth Qwen repos the table curated on 2026-08-21, whose only non-GGUF files
were `.gitattributes`, `README.md` and an imatrix calibration file. The
shortlist has since gained repos where it is plainly false:
`unsloth/gemma-4-E4B-it-GGUF` carries a root `config.json` and an `MTP/`
folder, and `LiquidAI/LFM2.5-1.2B-Instruct-GGUF` a `leap/` directory of
runtime manifests. None of it is fetched and none of it is missed, which is
the proof that the format was always doing the work. Stating it as a property
of the repos would have made a correct implementation look like a lucky one,
and would have argued against curating either of them.

Five things are true of this runner and of no other text runner here, and all
five are llama.cpp's doing. Three of them are stated as contrasts with the
transformers runner this app shipped until D416 (`torch_text.py`), because that
is the shape the difference has and the reasoning does not become wrong when
the other side of the comparison is deleted — only unvisitable:

* **GPU offload is decided by the LINKED BUILD, never by this module knowing
  which folder imported it.** `llamacpp_text/` and `llamacpp_text_vulkan/`
  install the SAME `llama-cpp-python==0.3.29` pin against different wheel
  indexes, and this module must not branch on which one — a Vulkan-specific
  `if` here would be a difference between the two folders no test could see,
  the same rule the module docstring states about growing a second line of
  behaviour anywhere else. `llama_cpp.llama_supports_gpu_offload()` answers
  the question honestly instead: it is a real llama.cpp C API (not a
  `verbose`-log inference), and reading its implementation at the vendored
  commit (`src/llama.cpp`) shows it asks ggml's OWN backend registry for a
  real `GPU` or `IGPU` device — `ggml_backend_dev_by_type(...) != nullptr` —
  which is false on a CPU-only build (no GPU backend `.so` even linked),
  false on a Vulkan build with the loader present but no ICD registered (the
  backend registers zero devices), and true on Apple Silicon's Metal-linked
  wheel and a Vulkan build with a working driver alike. So the SAME check
  gets Metal right on macOS for free, with no Apple-specific code, which is
  the whole reason this is one shared module and not three.
  `n_gpu_layers` defaults to `0` in `llama-cpp-python` — verified against
  0.3.29's own `Llama.__init__` signature — so leaving it unset was silently
  CPU-only even on a Vulkan install; `load()` below now asks first.
* **Offload is SIZED BY TRYING, because nothing in this binding can size it
  by CALCULATING.** llama.cpp does not check available VRAM before
  allocating a layer's GPU buffer — `llama-model.cpp` only clamps the
  requested count to the model's own total layer count
  (`n_gpu = std::min(n_gpu_layers, n_layer_all)`), never to what the device
  has free — and `llama_cpp.py`'s ctypes surface has no binding for
  `ggml_backend_dev_memory` or any other free-VRAM query, confirmed by
  reading the installed package. A buffer allocation that does not fit
  raises a catchable Python exception rather than aborting the process
  (`llama_model_load`'s own `try`/`catch` in `src/llama.cpp` converts it to a
  clean load failure, read at the vendored commit) — so `load()` exploits
  that: it reads the model's own layer count off its GGUF header
  (`formats.gguf_block_count`) and tries a shrinking sequence of offload
  counts, catching each failed attempt and trying fewer layers, down to `0`
  (pure CPU) as the guaranteed-to-work floor. A hard OOM that kills the Load
  button outright would be the worse failure mode for a 4-8GB laptop GPU
  asked to hold a model sized for a bigger one; a slower partial load is not.
* **A mixture-of-experts model gets one extra rung that dense models cannot
  use (D418).** Its expert tensors are most of the weights but only a few are
  multiplied per token, so `_experts_on_cpu` pins just those to system RAM
  and leaves every LAYER on the GPU — less VRAM than the smallest dense rung
  and more throughput at the same time, which is why it sits directly above
  pure CPU rather than anywhere higher. See `_offload_schedule` for the
  measurements that fix that position, and `_experts_on_cpu` for why it costs
  a monkeypatch that no version bump will retire.
* **The reported device now reflects what actually happened, not what this
  runner assumed.** `worker_base.set_state(device=...)` is `"cpu"`, `"gpu"`
  (every layer offloaded), `"gpu (partial)"` (the backoff above landed on
  fewer than the model's own total) or `"gpu (experts on cpu)"` (every layer
  offloaded, expert weights in system RAM) — a MEASUREMENT of which attempt
  succeeded, the same principle AI-11b already states about reporting a probed
  device rather than an assumed one. It cannot say "Vulkan" or "Metal" by name: nothing in the
  bound API reports which backend actually served the request, only whether
  a GPU-shaped device existed at all.
* **The chat template is rendered by hand, from the GGUF's own embedded jinja2
  source, because `create_completion(stream=True)` — not
  `create_chat_completion` — is what keeps the streaming contract identical to
  every other runner's NDJSON shape (`worker_base`).** `create_chat_completion`'s streaming
  reply is OpenAI-delta-shaped and would need reshaping back into this app's
  `{"type": "chunk"}` frames anyway, so rendering the prompt ourselves and
  calling the low-level completion API keeps one code path instead of two.
  `enable_thinking=False` is passed into the render context unconditionally,
  the same default the removed `torch_text._apply_template` chose and for the
  same reason (AI-11d): three of this runner's curated models are Qwen3.5
  GGUFs, whose upstream template defaults reasoning ON. Jinja simply ignores a
  context variable a template never references, so — unlike transformers'
  `apply_chat_template`, which can raise on an unexpected keyword — no retry
  is needed here.
* **Cancelling needs no thread.** transformers' `model.generate` owned its own
  loop, so a `StoppingCriteria` callback was the only interruption point and a
  producer thread was required to let `TextIteratorStreamer` hand tokens back
  to that process while generation ran. `Llama.create_completion(stream=True)`
  is an ordinary Python generator that computes one token per `next()` — this
  loop IS the token loop — so checking `worker_base.CANCEL` between iterations
  is the whole of cancellation, and a `write()` that raises on a client
  disconnect simply propagates out of `generate()` with nothing left running
  and nothing to join.

**`llm._model.token_get_text` and `llm._model.add_bos_token`, not the public
`Llama` surface — verified against the installed 0.3.29, not assumed.**
`Llama` itself has `token_bos`/`token_eos`/`tokenize`/`detokenize` and no
`token_get_text` at all; the vocabulary lookup and the "does this model
auto-add BOS" flag live on the internal `LlamaModel` at `Llama._model`, which
is exactly where `Llama.__init__` itself reads them when it builds its OWN
`bos_token`/`eos_token` strings for `create_chat_completion`'s chat-format
table (`llama_cpp/llama.py`, the block that populates `self._chat_handlers`).
Leading underscore or not, this is upstream's own canonical path for this
exact question, not a private implementation detail this module is guessing
its way into.

Deliberately llama-cpp-python + jinja2 + huggingface_hub only. No FastAPI, no
requests — this process must start fast, and its dependency list is a thing
users download.

    1. No budget known (`_memory_budget_bytes()` is `None` — an older

       because RAM could not be read). Nothing to judge against.

       Hub listing failed). Nothing to pick FROM.
    3. **The curated file's own size, from that SAME listing, already fits
       the budget.** This is the floor/default guarantee in code: a machine
       for which the curated recipe was always going to work sees ZERO
       behaviour change — the exact file, the exact bytes, the exact
       identity every other reader of `GGUF_RECIPES` (the catalog's
       `size_gb` promise, `hub_cache.is_downloaded`'s cache check,
       `catalog.mirror_id`) already assumes. Budget-awareness only ever
       ENGAGES when the curated default is already known not to fit.

    When the curated file genuinely does not fit, `formats.select_gguf_
    recipe` picks the best-quality file from the SAME repo's own listing
    that does — real, measured sizes throughout (never `params x bpp`; this
    caller never passes `params`, so a group with no known size is simply
    excluded, per that function's own "no evidence, no guess" rule). If
    NOTHING in the repo fits either, the curated recipe is returned anyway
    — `llama_text._offload_schedule`'s existing CPU-offload backoff is what
    makes proceeding affordable (a load that is slower rather than a
    download that is refused), the identical reasoning `formats.py`'s own
    module note gives for `pick_gguf_file` staying hardware-blind.

    **Known, accepted gap — reported, not hidden:** a downgraded pick is
    fetched under the SAME curated `model_id`, but nothing server-side
    (`hub_cache.is_downloaded`, the catalog's checkmark, the displayed
    `size_gb`) knows the actual file differs from the curated one — those
    readers have no network access on the polled catalog route (by design,
    code review finding 1) and cannot re-derive this pick without one. The
    checkmark may therefore under-report "downloaded" for a budget-
    downgraded model; the worst case is a redundant but harmless re-check

    second network call), never data loss or a crash.

    layer count, because there are TWO ways to use less VRAM and they are not
    interchangeable — see `_experts_on_cpu` for the second one.

    See the module docstring's "sized by trying, not calculating" note for
    why this exists at all. `total_layers` is the model's own layer count,
    read off its GGUF header by the caller (`formats.gguf_block_count`) —
    passed in rather than read here so `load()` reads the file's header
    exactly once. When it is known, the schedule steps down through roughly
    thirds of it (a shrinking sequence that reaches `0` in a bounded number
    of attempts regardless of how many layers the model has, rather than
    decrementing by ones), deduplicated and sorted so a small model's
    rounding never repeats a step. When it is `None` (the header could not be
    read), there is nothing to fraction against, so the dense part collapses
    to `(-1, False)` then `(0, False)` — llama.cpp's own "all layers"
    sentinel, then pure CPU — which still gets a working fallback, just
    without an intermediate partial-offload step. The expert rung below needs
    no layer count (it moves TENSORS, not layers), so it survives that
    collapse.

    **`has_experts` inserts one extra rung immediately above pure CPU**, and
    only for a mixture-of-experts model (`formats.gguf_expert_count`). It
    keeps EVERY layer on the GPU and moves just the expert tensors to system
    RAM, which is both smaller and faster than the thirds-rung above it —
    measured on `LFM2.5-8B-A1B-Q4_K_M` (24 layers, 32 experts, 4 used per
    token) against a Radeon RX 9060 XT, warm, median of three 64-token
    generations:

        24 layers, dense       4909 MiB VRAM   161.6 tok/s
         8 layers, dense       1731 MiB VRAM    55.6 tok/s
         3 layers, dense        659 MiB VRAM    41.4 tok/s
        all layers, experts     462 MiB VRAM    50.5 tok/s   <- this rung

    So it goes BELOW the fractional rungs, not above them: full offload is
    three times faster than any split and must still be tried first, and the
    thirds beat it whenever they fit. It earns its place only against the
    bottom rung, which it dominates on both axes at once — less VRAM AND more
    throughput — which is the whole argument for the rung existing. The gain
    is real but modest (+22% here); it grows with the fraction of a model's
    weights that are experts, and this row is a mild case at 4-of-32.

    consults per tensor, here matching the expert weights and sending them to
    the CPU buffer type. Experts are ordinary tensors and are all LOADED
    either way — only where they live differs, and only the COMPUTE was ever
    conditional.

    **Why a monkeypatch and not an argument.** `llama_cpp.Llama.__init__`
    never touches `tensor_buft_overrides`; it fills a fresh
    `llama_model_default_params()` and constructs the model in the same call,
    so there is no object to reach between the two. Its `**kwargs` are
    swallowed, not forwarded. Checked against 0.3.29 (our pin), 0.3.32 and
    0.3.35 (latest as of 2026-08-21) — all three still carry the binding's own
    `("tensor_buft_overrides", ctypes.c_void_p),  # NOTE: unused` and no live
    reference in `llama.py`, so BUMPING THE PIN DOES NOT REMOVE THIS HACK, and
    a bump should not be taken as a reason to go looking. Patch the factory,
    restore it in `finally`, keep the array alive across the `yield` — a
    freed array would leave the C side reading released memory.

    Two things make it far less invasive than it sounds. The struct field is
    already declared `c_void_p`, so the params struct needs no redeclaring —
    a plain `cast` fills it. And `ggml_backend_cpu_buffer_type` is reachable
    on `llama_cpp._lib`, the handle the binding has already opened, so there
    is no second `dlopen` and no `.so`/`.dylib` name to get right per
    platform.

    Failing to build the override is NOT fatal: it costs throughput, never
    correctness, and the caller's next rung is plain CPU anyway. So a binding

    """`{type_k, type_v, flash_attn}` for a q8_0-quantized KV cache, or `{}`.

    **Why this exists at all.** No engine in this codebase quantizes its KV
    cache today — `fit.py`'s `KV_BYTES_PER_ELEMENT` table already models the
    axis (`fp16`/`bf16`/`fp8`/`q8_0`/`q4_0`) and its own docstring says so
    outright ("fp16 ... the precision every runner in this codebase caches
    at today"). This is where that stops being true for llama.cpp, and it
    matters more HERE than for any other runner: `load()`'s retry ladder
    (`_offload_schedule`) probes decreasing `n_gpu_layers` until one FITS in
    VRAM, and the KV cache is allocated as part of that same fit. Shrinking
    it does not just save memory in the abstract — every byte it gives back
    is a byte the ladder can spend on one more GPU layer, at every rung, not
    only the ones that were already tight.

    **q8_0, not q4_0.** Both are in `fit.py`'s table; only one is shipped
    here. q8_0 is llama.cpp's near-lossless KV option — an 8-bit block
    quantization with a scale per block, close enough to fp16 that upstream
    treats it as the safe default recommendation for a cache users did not
    ask to be made lossy. q4_0 roughly halves the bytes again (`fit.py`'s
    table: 0.5 vs 1.0 bytes/element) but visibly degrades long-context
    recall in the model's own attention outputs — a probabilistic quality
    cost this runner has no way to warn a caller about after the fact, for
    a worse trade than "one more layer stays on the GPU" is worth. This
    runner is a chat-turn server, not a long-document summarizer straining
    for every extra megabyte (see `_N_CTX`'s own docstring), so q8_0's
    smaller, guaranteed-safe win is the one worth taking unconditionally;
    q4_0's larger, riskier one is not.

    **Paired with `flash_attn=True`, not optional.** llama.cpp's own loader
    enforces this, not a preference of this runner's: `llama-context.cpp`
    (checked at `ggml-org/llama.cpp` HEAD) constructs the context with
    `if (!cparams.flash_attn) { if (ggml_is_quantized(params.type_v)) {
    throw std::runtime_error("quantized V cache was requested, but this
    requires Flash Attention"); } }` — a quantized V cache without flash
    attention is not slower, it is a load-time exception. This guard
    predates the 0.3.29 pin by a long margin (quantized KV cache and this
    exact check have existed since llama.cpp's KV-quantization feature
    shipped), so pairing the two unconditionally is not a guess.

    **Verified against the pin.** `llama-cpp-python==0.3.29`
    (`llamacpp_text/pyproject.toml`) is installed, and every fact this
    function leans on holds against it: `Llama.__init__` accepts
    `type_k: Optional[int] = None` and `type_v: Optional[int] = None` ("KV
    cache data type for K/V (default: f16)") and `flash_attn: bool = False`
    ("Use flash attention"), setting `context_params.type_k`/`type_v` only
    when given and mapping `flash_attn` to
    `LLAMA_FLASH_ATTN_TYPE_ENABLED`/`_DISABLED` — confirmed against
    https://github.com/abetlen/llama-cpp-python/blob/v0.3.29/llama_cpp/llama.py.
    The enum value comes from the same pin's `llama_cpp.py`
    (https://github.com/abetlen/llama-cpp-python/blob/v0.3.29/llama_cpp/llama_cpp.py):
    `GGML_TYPE_Q8_0 = 8`, and the installed package re-exports the same
    value at `llama_cpp.GGML_TYPE_Q8_0` — a plain read, not the write the
    `_Override` context manager above patches on the submodule instead.
    Read off the binding rather than hardcoded, both so a future
    renumbering (it never has happened) fails loudly instead of picking
    silently wrong, and so a binding that dropped the constant answers `{}`
    here instead of raising — see the caller for what that `{}` falls back
    to.

    **Two builds, one pin, one fallback path.** `llamacpp_text/` and
    `llamacpp_text_vulkan/` share this exact version pin but link different
    llama.cpp backends, and Vulkan's flash-attention/quantized-cache support
    is not guaranteed to match the CPU build's rung for rung. Rather than
    gate this on which folder imported the module (the module docstring's
    "decided by the linked build" rule applies here too), `load()` tries the
    quantized cache first at EACH rung of the offload schedule and, only if
    that rung's quantized attempt fails, retries that SAME rung with a plain
    fp16 cache before moving down to a smaller rung (`_load_across_schedule`
    does the retrying). Falling back per-rung rather than per-whole-ladder
    matters because `_offload_schedule` always ends on plain CPU (`0`), which
    typically accepts a quantized cache even on a build whose GPU backend
    rejects `flash_attn` plus a quantized V cache — a per-ladder fallback
    would walk every GPU rung with the (rejected) quantized cache, land on
    CPU, and stop there, never trying fp16 at the GPU rungs that would have
    fit it. Per-rung fallback keeps "a GPU rung at fp16" preferred over "CPU
    at q8_0", which is the ordering that actually uses the hardware.

    `kv_variants` is an ordered tuple of extra `Llama()` kwargs dicts (see

    quantized cache, or just `({},)` when it does not. At a given rung, every
    variant is tried in order before that rung is declared a failure and the
    schedule moves down to the next, smaller rung. This is what makes "GPU at
