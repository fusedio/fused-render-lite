"""Speaker diarization: who spoke when, and which words are theirs (SPEC §40).

`fused.ai.transcribe({diarize: true, speakers: N})` puts a `speaker` on every
segment. **This module is the whole of that feature**, and it sits at the
runners ROOT — beside `worker_base.py` and `formats.py` — rather than inside
either whisper folder, for the reason AI-10c states about `vad`: two engines
serve one capability, and a page must not be able to tell which one ran. A
second copy under `faster_whisper/` would be two implementations of one promise,
free to drift on the labels, the tie-breaks and the output shape. There is one,
and both venvs import it through the same `sys.path` insert that reaches
`worker_base`.

**Stdlib, numpy and sherpa-onnx only — no import of `fused_render_app`.** The same
constraint `formats.py` documents, for the same reason: each runner runs on its
own interpreter with the app's package deliberately off its path. The server
imports this module too (for `speakers_or_raise`, so the bridge is not the only
door that enforces the argument), which is why every heavy import below is
inside a function: reading the validation rule must not need sherpa-onnx.

**sherpa-onnx, not pyannote.audio**, and the dependency is the decision. pyannote
needs PyTorch, which `mlx_whisper/pyproject.toml` refuses on principle for a
small helper model — gigabytes in the venv whose selling point is that it is
small — and `pyannote/speaker-diarization-3.1` is `gated: auto`, so an
unattended download fails without a Hub token on a machine nobody is sitting at.
sherpa-onnx runs on ONNX Runtime, which the MLX runner already carries for the
VAD, and both models below are ungated.

**The count is a HINT: given, it is obeyed; omitted, it is estimated** (D318).
sherpa's clustering takes either a cluster count or a cosine distance
threshold, and this module offers both — `speakers: 3` fixes three clusters and
is the path that existed first, while an absent `speakers` clusters by distance
and lets the recording answer. The earlier reading of this file said the
threshold was a number nobody outside a lab could set and therefore REFUSED the
absent case; what that missed is that the app can set it once, for everyone,
which is what every other transcription product does. A wrong estimate is still
a real cost — it is why the count remains the better answer whenever the caller
has one — but a refusal is not the alternative it was taken to be. The value is
still validated in three places (the bridge, the server and each worker),
because a BAD count (`0`, `-1`, `true`, `"2"`) is a typo either way, and the
rule is written down once, here.

**Diarization runs on the FULL waveform, independent of the VAD.** It is the
segmenter's own job to find the silence, it is much better at it than a
threshold over Silero probabilities, and feeding it VAD regions would mean
clustering voices across cuts that were made for a different purpose. Turns come
back in original-recording time; `_transcribe_regions` already maps every
segment back into that same clock, so `assign_speakers` is a join in one
coordinate system rather than a remap.

#: How many CPU threads BOTH ONNX models get. One constant for the two of them,

#:
#: It was `1`, under a comment that thought it was restating a library default.

#: the footnote the CPU-provider note below used to call it: on a 216-second
#: recording on a 10-core Apple Silicon machine it ran in 26.64s on one thread,
#: 14.80s on two and 11.55s on four. Embedding and clustering together measured
#: ~0s, so this number is essentially the whole of the phase's wall clock.
#:
#: **The output was identical at 1, 2, 4 and 8 threads** — the same 48 turns and
#: the same 6 speakers — which is the evidence that made this safe to change, and
#: the limit of that evidence is one machine and one recording. It is not a
#: guarantee: ONNX Runtime's intra-op parallelism can in principle reorder
#: floating-point reductions, which would perturb the posteriors and so the turn
#: boundaries, and this value is host-dependent by design. `diarizer` states what
#: is and is not promised as a result.
#:
#: **The cap of 4 is load-bearing, and this is the reason it is not a magic
#: number:** eight threads measured 16.79s — SLOWER than four's 11.55s — on that
#: same 10-core part. Every current Apple Silicon design is performance cores
#: plus efficiency cores, so threads past the P-core count land on the slow ones
#: and the segmentation pass ends up waiting for them. `os.cpu_count()` uncapped
#: is therefore a pessimisation on every machine this runner ships to, in the
#: same way `1` was in the other direction. `or 1` because `os.cpu_count()` is
#: documented to be able to return None, and `num_threads=None` is a C++ config
#: field this process would abort on rather than raise about.
NUM_THREADS = min(4, os.cpu_count() or 1)

#: How much of a lead counts as a real one when two speakers overlap a segment.
#: Overlaps are differences of floats and two turns that are equal on paper
#: rarely are in binary, so a bare `==` tie-break would never fire and the
#: winner would be whichever rounding error was larger. A microsecond is far
#: below any boundary either model can resolve.
_TIE_S = 1e-6

#: The most speakers this will accept. Not a property of the model — sherpa

#: whatever the installed wheel happens to default to this month, and the two
#: engines must not be able to pick up different ones. Larger merges more —
#: two people become one — and smaller splits one person across a cough or a
#: change of microphone distance. 0.5 is where sherpa's own examples sit for the

    `speakers` is a count, or **None to estimate it** (D318), and that single
    argument chooses between the two branches of sherpa's clustering:

    * a count fixes `num_clusters`, and the recording is cut into exactly that
      many voices whether or not that is how many spoke;
    * None leaves `num_clusters` negative and hands over `CLUSTER_THRESHOLD`
      instead, so voices merge by cosine distance and the count falls out.

    The fixed branch is spelled exactly as it was before the other one existed,
    with no `threshold` passed: a caller who gives the count must not have their
    clustering quietly re-tuned by a feature they did not ask for, and the surest
    way to promise that is to leave its call untouched.

    **That promise is about the CALL, not about the bytes**, and the distinction
    is not pedantry — it used to read "the same transcript they got yesterday,
    byte for byte", which is more than this file can honestly claim now that
    `NUM_THREADS` derives from `os.cpu_count()`. ONNX Runtime's intra-op
    parallelism can in principle change the order of floating-point reductions,
    and a different order perturbs the segmentation posteriors and therefore the
    turn boundaries. What was actually established is narrower than a guarantee
    and is worth writing down as such: on ONE machine and ONE 216-second
    recording, 1, 2, 4 and 8 threads produced identical output — the same 48
    turns and the same 6 speakers. That is real evidence that this model's
    reductions are stable under threading, and it is not proof that they must be
    on every part and every recording. A transcript that differs across machines
    by a few milliseconds of turn boundary is the accepted cost of the phase
    taking 11.5s instead of 26.6s (see `NUM_THREADS`); what is NOT accepted is
    the label set changing, which is what the count-fixing branch above pins.

    CPU provider explicitly, and NOT because this is cheap — it is not. The
    segmentation pass is the dominant cost of a diarized transcription (26.6s of
    a 216-second recording on one thread; see `NUM_THREADS`), and the sentence
    that used to sit here — "33MB of ONNX that runs in seconds" — asserted a
    timing this phase never had. What survives that correction is the rest of
    `vad.py`'s reason, which does not depend on the size of the model: a second
    accelerator backend beside the one holding the Whisper weights buys nothing
    measured (CoreML measured SLOWER than CPU for ASR — sherpa-onnx#2910), and
    onnxruntime's provider-fallback warnings would land in the worker log on
    every transcription. The answer to the cost is `NUM_THREADS`, not a

    another's, and the person who said most of it is the honest label.

    **`spans` masks the SCORING to the intervals where speech actually was**, and

    `mlx_whisper` concatenates VAD regions into one `transcribe()` call (AI-10f,
    D366), so Whisper hears one continuous sentence across a pause that is not in
    the clip it was given and can emit a segment whose remapped start and end sit
    in different regions. Its published start and end are RIGHT — the words
    really do sit either side of the pause, and a page seeking a player wants the
    real interval — but scoring the whole span is not: diarization runs on the
    FULL waveform (deliberately, see the module docstring) and routinely has
    turns inside the gap, so the label went to whoever the segmenter heard during
    the silence rather than to whoever said the words. Masked, time inside a
    dropped silence contributes zero to every speaker's total, and the segment is
    labelled by its words.

    **None means "score the whole span", and that is the default on purpose.**
    `faster_whisper` and a non-VAD `mlx_whisper` run drop no silence out of the

    be a no-op with a risk attached. They pass nothing and are byte-identical
    to before this argument existed.

    **Summed PER SPEAKER, not per turn.** One speaker can hold several turns
    inside one segment (a short interjection splits theirs in two), and taking
    the single longest TURN would hand the segment to the interrupter who spoke
    for two seconds over the person who spoke for six across three turns.

    **Ties go to whoever started speaking first** — the speaker whose earliest
    overlapping turn begins earliest, and if even that is equal, the lower
    speaker index. A tie is rare and either answer is defensible; what is not

    recording labels differently on two runs and a page's speaker colours
    shuffle between them. Determinism is the property being bought.

    drops nothing, scoring exactly as it did before the mask existed.

    Mutates in place, because the segments ARE the transcript both engines are
    about to write and copying them would leave two lists to keep in step.

    The returned list is the transcript's legend — the top-level `speakers` in
    the written JSON — and it is derived from what was actually ASSIGNED rather
    than from the turns. A speaker the segmenter heard during a stretch Whisper
    transcribed no words from would otherwise appear in a legend that nothing in
    the transcript refers to, which reads as a bug in the page rendering it.
    Sorted by index, so "Speaker 10" sorts after "Speaker 2" rather than before
    it — the reason `speaker_turns` carries integers this far.
