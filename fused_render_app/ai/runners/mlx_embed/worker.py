"""Embeddings on MLX: one resident encoder, one or two towers (SPEC §40).

Started by `fused_render_app.ai.supervisor` on the interpreter built from this
folder's `pyproject.toml`. The HTTP contract, the download reporting and the
state machine are `worker_base`'s; what lives here is only what is true of
`mlx-embeddings`' own ports in particular.

**TWO SHAPES OF CHECKPOINT, one folder.** A DUAL ENCODER (`siglip`) has a text
tower and a vision tower and answers both `texts` and `paths`. A PROSE ENCODER
(`bert`, `xlm-roberta`, `modernbert`) has one tower, is read through a different
call, and refuses `paths` by name. `mlx-embeddings` 0.1.0 ships modules for all
of those and dispatches on `model_type` itself, so ONE install serves both; the
fork here is decided once, in `load()`, off `formats.embed_model_type` over the
cached `config.json`.

**ONE FOLDER, and that is a decision rather than an omission.** PR #780 put the
text encoders in a second folder, `mlx_text_embed/`, and was right to: text
embeddings were a separate CAPABILITY there, so a second folder meant a second
resident slot for it. Unified, a second folder would buy a second venv (another
mlx-embeddings install), a second resident slot and a second copy of
`_pin_stream` — and the extra slot is not a feature. The app's contract is one
resident model per capability, and a Mac holding a SigLIP and a BERT at once is
over budget in exactly the way that contract exists to prevent.
`tests/test_ai_mlx_embed_worker.py` asserts the folder list, so it cannot creep
back.

**Only SigLIP, never CLIP, on the dual side.** `mlx-embeddings` 0.1.x ships a
`siglip` module and no `clip` one, so a CLIP checkpoint in safetensors resolves
to NOTHING at all here (`formats.MLX_EMBED_MODEL_TYPES`, and `registry`'s
comment on this row) — `onnx_embed` reads a CLIP graph export, but that is a
different file. This file never sees one and has no branch for it.

**`mlx_embeddings.load()` does the whole load**, unlike `mlx_text`'s bare
`mlx_lm.load`: it also resolves the processor (`AutoProcessor` for a model
whose config carries a `vision_config`, which SigLIP's does), so there is no
separate processor line here the way `runners/onnx_embed.py` has one — the
library already made that choice for a checkpoint shaped like this one.

`embed_common.py` (one directory up) is where the request validation and the
unit-normalization live, shared with `runners/onnx_embed.py` because the two
engines produce vectors in the SAME SPACE (`registry.py`'s comment on this row)
and must refuse and shape a request identically.

#: ceiling exists so that cannot arrive unannounced.)
_TEXT_EMBEDS_FIELD = "text_embeds"

#: A sanity ceiling on what a config may claim, and the floor to fall back to.
#: `max_position_embeddings` carries a `1e30`-scale sentinel on some exports,
#: and asking the tokenizer to pad to that is an allocation failure rather than
#: a slow call. 512 is the BERT-family trained length and the conservative
#: answer for anything unrecognised.
_MAX_TEXT_LENGTH = 8192

_SENTINEL_TEXT_LENGTH = 1_000_000

#: A per-`model_type` ARCHITECTURAL default, consulted only when a checkpoint's

#: `_ARCH_TEXT_LENGTH`: `"siglip": 64` is read off

#: `text_model.embeddings.position_embedding.weight: [64, 768]`, fetched by an
#: HTTP byte-range read rather than assumed — because no config here or in
#: `onnx_embed`'s copy carries `max_position_embeddings` for a SigLIP2 export.
#: `"clip"` stays out for the same reason it stays out there: `mlx-embeddings`
#: 0.1.x ships no `clip` module at all (this file's own docstring, and
#: `formats.MLX_EMBED_MODEL_TYPES`), so there is no checkpoint reachable from
#: this runner to read a tensor shape off.
_ARCH_TEXT_LENGTH = {"siglip": 64}

    **PR #780 used a flat `_MAX_LENGTH = 512` and its own docstring conceded the
    cost**: correct for the BERT-family encoders that trained at 512, and LOSSY
    for anything longer — a ModernBERT trains at 8192, so a long passage would
    be silently cut at a sixteenth of what the model can read, with the vectors
    still coming back unit length and describing the first paragraph. That was a
    deliberate compromise made from a machine that could not run the code; the
    config states the real number and this reads it.

    Bounded above by `_MAX_TEXT_LENGTH` because `max_position_embeddings`
    carries a sentinel on some exports, and below by `_DEFAULT_TEXT_LENGTH`
    because a config that says nothing is a BERT until proven otherwise. A
    number SMALLER than the model's maximum is a shorter read; a LARGER one
    indexes past its position embeddings, which is why the ceiling is a clamp
    and not a warning.

    **And now it actually clamps.** The test used to read
    `0 < value <= _MAX_TEXT_LENGTH`, which is a filter and not a clamp: a config
    declaring 8194 failed it, fell through to `_DEFAULT_TEXT_LENGTH` and read 512
    — the exact silent sixteenth-of-the-model truncation the paragraph above
    describes as the thing this function was written to stop. The sentinel is
    still discarded rather than clamped, because clamping it would turn a missing
    answer into a confident wrong one; `_SENTINEL_TEXT_LENGTH` is that line.

    Unlike `onnx_embed`'s copy this does NOT take the min with the tokenizer's
    `model_max_length`, which is what saves that runner from RoBERTa's
    usable-length-plus-two offset. It has no need to yet: the offset only appears
    on RoBERTa/XLM-R, and neither curated MLX row is one. Anything from that
    family arriving on this list is the signal to bring the min over.

    **`_ARCH_TEXT_LENGTH` is consulted only when the config says nothing at
    all, and only before `_DEFAULT_TEXT_LENGTH` — never ahead of a declared
    value.** Every curated SigLIP2 row is exactly that silent case: no config
    here carries `max_position_embeddings` for one, and this runner never even
    reads `tokenizer_config.json`'s `model_max_length` (see the paragraph
    above), so without this dict a SigLIP2 config with nothing declared would
    fall straight to `_DEFAULT_TEXT_LENGTH` — 512 against a 64-position text
    tower.

    A DUAL encoder that is silent on BOTH counts refuses instead: the caller
    (`_text_vectors`, through `load()`) pads to exactly this length with
    `padding="max_length"` against a graph that takes no attention mask, so a
    wrong number here is not a worse vector, it is a real gather past the

    this runner can reach returns a `BaseModelOutput` whose `text_embeds` is
    already pooled by whichever strategy that architecture was trained for —
    mean for BERT and XLM-RoBERTa, config-driven for ModernBERT. So there is no
    pooling BRANCH here, and adding one would be actively wrong: it would
    second-guess the library about a choice the checkpoint's own config records.
    (`runners/onnx_embed.py` DOES pool, and has to: an ONNX graph is a graph, so
    the pooling module was never compiled into it and `1_Pooling/config.json` is
    the only record of the mode. The asymmetry between the two runners is real
    and is a property of the two formats, not an inconsistency.)

    The vectors come back L2-normalized too (`base.normalize_embeddings`, called
    inside each of those `__call__`s), and `embed_common.unit_normalize` still
    runs over them afterwards in `generate` — re-normalizing an already-unit
    vector is a no-op to within float error, and paying for that no-op is much
    cheaper than a future upstream quietly stopping.

    `batch_encode_plus` with `padding=True` is upstream's own documented call,
    copied from the "Multiple Texts Comparison" example in the wheel's
    METADATA — padding to the batch's LONGEST, which is correct here for the
    reason `onnx_embed._tokenizer` states at length: a BERT-family model takes
    an attention mask and ignores its pads.
