"""Validating and shaping one `fused.ai.embed()` request, written once (SPEC §40).

`mlx_embed` and `onnx_embed` are two DIFFERENT engines that produce vectors in
the SAME SPACE (see `catalog.py`'s embeddings blocks, and `registry.EMBEDDINGS`'s
own comment) — the one pair here where that is true. A caller must therefore
get the same answer to "is this request well-formed" and "what does this
vector mean" whichever engine served it, which is exactly the kind of rule a
second copy drifts on. This module is where both halves of `generate()` that
have nothing to do with a text tower or a vision tower live, so neither
worker has to re-derive them.

(They read different FILES — MLX safetensors against an `onnx/` graph export —
which is why `catalog.py` keeps two lists. That is a fact about downloads and
changes nothing about the request shape, which is this module's whole subject.)

**Mostly stdlib, and no import of `fused_render_app`** — the same constraint
`formats.py` documents, for the same reason: this is imported by both runners'
own interpreters through the same `sys.path` insert that reaches
`worker_base`. `open_image` is the one exception, and it defers its PIL import
to the call itself (never at module load) — pillow is a dependency BOTH of
these two runners declare, unlike onnxruntime or mlx-embeddings, so importing it
lazily here costs nothing neither runner already pays, and costs it only when
a page actually asked to embed an image.

#: The two things a text can BE to a retrieval model, and what a caller who says
#: nothing gets. Both live in `formats` because BOTH runners and the SERVER read
#: them — the route reports the resolved scheme on every catalog entry — and a
#: second literal here is the copy that goes stale.
KINDS = formats.TEXT_EMBED_KINDS

#: **"document", and it is the one defaulting decision in this file that could
#: quietly cost someone their recall, so here is the whole argument** (ported
#: from PR #780, whose `text_embed_common.py` argues it at length).
#:
#: There is no neutral option. Every scheme in `formats.TEXT_EMBED_PROMPTS` has
#: two sides and a call must pick one, so the question is only which wrong guess
#: is cheaper when the caller has not thought about it yet.
#:
#: * Default "query", and someone who indexes a corpus with a bare call stamps
#:   the query instruction onto ten thousand passages. Every later search then
#:   compares a properly-prefixed query against a corpus that claims to be ten
#:   thousand queries — the mismatched state, which is measurably worse than
#:   using no prefix at all (the e5 card says so outright about its own pair).
#: * Default "document", and the same person gets a corpus that is internally
#:   consistent. If they never discover `kind`, every text in the system —
#:   corpus and query alike — carries the same prefix, which is the SYMMETRIC
#:   behaviour every one of these models supports and the behaviour every
#:   encoder had before asymmetric prompting existed. It is not optimal; it
#:   degrades gracefully rather than to the mismatched state.
#:
#: The tie-breaker is `bge`: its document side is the EMPTY string, because its
#: card instructs the query only. So on that family this default means a bare
#: call embeds text verbatim — precisely what someone who has not read about
#: prompt schemes expects to happen — while the opposite default would silently
#: prepend a sentence about searching to text nobody was searching.
#:
#: Documented on the bridge (`fused.ai.embed`) as well, because a default whose
#: reasoning lives only in the runner is a default page authors cannot act on.
DEFAULT_KIND = formats.TEXT_EMBED_DEFAULT_KIND

#: Above this a batch is refused rather than run. The same number
#: `ai_runtime.api_ai_embed` checks before a job ever starts — restated here,
#: not merely trusted from there, because `generate()` is also reachable
#: through the worker's own `/generate` route directly (a test drives it that
#: way, and so would any caller that is not the app's own router).

def request_kind(body: dict) -> tuple[str, list, str]:
    """`("texts"|"paths", items, "query"|"document")`, or a `ValueError` naming
    what is wrong.

    The one shape both engines accept: EXACTLY one of `texts`/`paths`, a
    non-empty list of non-empty strings, at most `MAX_ITEMS` long, and an
    optional retrieval `kind`. Checked once so a batch of 65 does not read as an
    ONNX limit on one engine and an MLX one on the other — the same argument
    `MAX_ITEMS` above makes.

    **THREE values, and the third is why this is a wider tuple rather than a
    second function beside it.** `kind` picks which half of a retrieval model's
    prompt pair goes in front of these texts, and a caller who never asked for
    it gets `DEFAULT_KIND` — so a worker that forgot to call an
    `embed_common.retrieval_kind(body)` would silently embed every query with
    the document prefix and return vectors that are unit length, correctly
    shaped and worse. Widening the tuple makes that omission a `ValueError` at
    unpack time instead of a recall regression nobody attributes to this call.
    Two engines and one route read this; the compiler is the reviewer.

    **An unrecognised `kind` is refused rather than defaulted**, for the same
    reason stated the other way round: it is the one field here whose wrong
    value produces no error anywhere downstream.

    **`kind` beside `paths` is refused too.** A prompt scheme instructs TEXT —
    `"search_query: "` glued to the front of a sentence — so there is nothing
    for it to prefix on an image. Accepting it would mean silently ignoring the
    only field the caller set.
