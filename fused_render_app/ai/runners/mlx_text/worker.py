"""Text generation on MLX: one resident model, four routes (SPEC §40).

Started by `fused_render_app.ai.supervisor` on the interpreter built from this
folder's `pyproject.toml`. Nothing in fused-render imports this file — it runs in
a different interpreter, and the only contract between them is HTTP, which
`worker_base` implements once for every runner:

    GET  /health    {state, model, detail, error, resident_bytes, loaded_at}
    POST /generate  {messages|prompt, images, max_tokens, temperature, top_p}
                    -> NDJSON
    POST /cancel    stop the generation in flight
    POST /quit      release the weights and exit

What is left HERE is only what is true of MLX in particular: how a chat prompt
is built, and how tokens come out. Downloading, reporting, the port handshake,
the auth check and the state machine are the base's, because they are the
supervisor's contract rather than this backend's behaviour.

Deliberately mlx-vlm only. No FastAPI, no requests — this process must start
fast and its dependency list is a thing users download.

    **MLX default streams are per-thread from mlx 0.32 on, and this worker is
    threaded.** `load` runs on `worker_base.serve`'s bring-up thread, which then
    exits; `generate` arrives on a `ThreadingTCPServer` request thread. An
    UNEVALUATED array is a graph pinned to the stream it was built on, and
    forcing it from another thread throws
    `std::runtime_error("There is no Stream(gpu, 1) in current thread")` out of
    `metal::get_command_encoder`, which is an UNCAUGHT C++ exception and aborts
    the process — see `mlx_whisper/worker.py::_pin_stream` for the same mechanism
    written out at length, and `mflux_image/worker.py::_pin_stream` for why both
    devices are pinned rather than the GPU alone.

    Every model switch respawns this worker as a fresh process (`supervisor.
    _start_resident`), so the FIRST message after a switch is, by construction,
    the first time any thread besides the bring-up thread touches that model's
    weights — exactly the trigger condition this pins against.

    `new_thread_unsafe_stream` is mlx's own answer: a stream not owned by the
    thread that made it. The sharing is the mechanism — one stream per device
    for the whole process, so a graph built on any thread is forceable on any
    other. "Unsafe" means it must not be driven by two threads AT ONCE, which
    this worker already guarantees: `worker_base.GENERATE_LOCK` serializes
    generations and the load completes before the server accepts a request.

    # A `PromptCacheState` (`mlx_vlm.PromptCacheState`, re-exported at the
    # package root per `mlx_vlm/__init__.py`) is a tiny object holding the
    # FULL TOKEN-ID LIST of the last processed prompt plus its live KV cache.
    # Handed to `stream_generate` as `prompt_cache_state=`, `dispatch.py`'s own
    # `find_prefix_length` walks the new turn's tokens against the stored ones
    # and returns how many agree from position 0 — the EXACT prefix identity
    # this needs, never a message count or a hash of a summary: any edit,
    # regeneration, branch, or system-prompt change changes a token somewhere
    # in that walk and the match stops exactly there, at worst returning 0.
    # `stream_generate` then trims its retained KV cache back to that many
    # tokens and prefills ONLY the new suffix — the old prefix's KV states are
    # reused rather than recomputed. **The safe path is the automatic
    # fallback, not a mode this file has to remember to choose**: a zero-length
    # (or otherwise unusable — a wrapped rotating-window cache, e.g.) match
    # falls straight through to `dispatch.py`'s own "ensure we have a
    # prompt_cache" branch, which builds a fresh one and cold-prefills the
    # whole prompt. Getting the match wrong in the OTHER direction — reusing a
    # prefix that is not actually a match — is the failure this cannot have
    # (text conditioned on the wrong conversation, silently), and it cannot
    # happen here because the comparison is a literal token-by-token walk, not
    # an approximation.
    #
    # **One `PromptCacheState`, kept across turns in `_loaded` for exactly as
    # long as this process keeps its model** — same lifetime as `model` and
    # `processor`, dropped in `release()` (this process's only mechanism for
    # giving retained memory back between chat bursts) and cleared again at
    # the top of `load()` in case a process ever loads a second model. Created
    # lazily, the first time a text-only turn asks for it, rather than in
    # `load()`: a model that only ever answers image turns should not pay for
    # a `PromptCacheState` it will never populate.
    #
    # **TEXT-ONLY TURNS ONLY — never on the branch that built `text` with an
    # attached image, above.** `dispatch.py` DOES carry its own image-turn
    # guard for this (`_apc_suffix_is_text_only`, sourced from
    # `mlx_vlm.apc.media_safe_prefix_min`: it refuses to reuse a cache whose
    # trimmed suffix would cut through a media-placeholder token), but reading
    # that guard's own source (`mlx_vlm/apc.py`) shows it only recognises
    # placeholder ids named `image_token_id`/`image_token_index`/
    # `video_token_id`/`video_token_index` in the checkpoint's config — and
    # this file's own vision-tower gate, just above, already had to learn the
    # hard way (its docstring: at least 18 real architectures) that mlx-vlm's
    # naming is NOT standardised across its model zoo. A checkpoint that
    # passes this file's OWN gate on `vision_config` alone, with none of those
    # four id keys, would make `dispatch.py`'s guard a silent no-op — the
    # exact "reusing a cache across turns with different attached images"
    # correctness bug that must not happen, on an architecture this file
    # cannot enumerate in advance. Excluding the whole image branch is
    # the same discipline `prompt_tokens = None if images` already applies a
    # few lines up: refuse to guess about the image path rather than trust a
    # check whose coverage this file cannot fully verify, and report/behave
    # honestly (a full reprocess) instead. This costs nothing on an ordinary
    # text turn threaded between image turns, either — the stored state is
    # simply left untouched by an image turn (never handed to
    # `stream_generate` there, so `dispatch.py` never calls `.update()` on
    # it), and the NEXT text-only turn still finds its own last text-only
    # prefix waiting, since conversation history is text-only to begin with
