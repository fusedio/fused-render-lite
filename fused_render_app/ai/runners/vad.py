"""Silero VAD over ONNX Runtime: which parts of a recording contain speech.

**Why this file exists at all is PARITY, not performance.** `fused.ai.transcribe`
takes a `vad` flag, and the engines serving that capability must mean the same
thing by it: `faster_whisper` runs a real Silero VAD filter over the waveform
and drops the silence, while the MLX runner could only map the flag onto
mlx-whisper's per-window `no_speech_threshold`. Same public API, same argument,
two behaviours — which is the one thing a second runner for a capability is not
allowed to be (SPEC AI-10c).

**It sits at the runners ROOT**, beside `worker_base.py`, `formats.py`,
`diarize.py` and `partial.py`, having moved here the moment a SECOND engine
needed it (D319 — the Parakeet runner, since withdrawn by D406). It began
inside `mlx_whisper/` because one runner used it and the CT2 engine had
faster-whisper's own copy; that was the right home for exactly as long as
there was one caller. Two callers of one promise is what the root is for: a
copy under a second runner's own folder would be two implementations of "what
`vad: true` means", free to drift on the threshold, the minimum silence and
the padding, and neither copy would fail a test — each would pass its own.
`mlx_whisper/worker.py` is the sole caller again since D406, and the module
stays at the root rather than moving back — the shared location costs nothing
with one caller and saves a second move the day another one arrives. Its
readers reach it through the same `sys.path` insert that reaches `worker_base`.

**Its reader is the MLX engine, not `faster_whisper`.** `faster_whisper/`
neither imports this nor should: faster-whisper ships the same Silero inside
itself and takes `vad_filter=True`, so asking for it there is one argument to a
library that already has the model. This file exists because the MLX engine
has no such library — which is the whole of AI-10f's argument, one engine
further on.

**It owns the PACKING too, not just the detection** (`pack_regions`,
`packed_samples` and the inverses `original_start`/`original_end`, at the foot of
this file). Deciding what the decoder is actually HANDED — one clip per region,
or the speech concatenated into as few clips as fit — is part of what `vad: true`
means, and this module is the one place allowed to define that. `parakeet_mlx`
never called into the packing before it was withdrawn: it had no fixed window
to pack into, a fact about that engine rather than a different reading of the
flag, and `mlx_whisper/worker.py` remains the only caller. The arithmetic is
stdlib and numpy, so a caller that wants it does not need onnxruntime to be
installed.

Three constraints shaped it, and each one closed off the obvious route:

* **Not `faster_whisper`'s copy of Silero.** It is right there and it is the
  same model — but importing it would pull `ctranslate2` into an MLX runner's
  venv, which is the whole thing the runner-folder split exists to prevent (a
  Metal-only environment does not get to carry a CPU inference engine because
  one utility module lives inside it).
* **Not the PyTorch Silero.** `torch.hub` would be a multi-GB dependency for a
  2MB model, in the venv whose entire selling point is that it is small.
* **So: the ONNX export, run on `onnxruntime`.** `onnx-community/silero-vad`
  is ungated (the rule `catalog.py` states about gated repos applies to
  everything this app downloads, not only to models a user picks) and the file
  is 2.2MB. Nothing here shells out, and no system ffmpeg is involved — the
  waveform arrives already decoded by the calling `worker.py`'s `av` path.

**Stdlib, numpy and onnxruntime only — no import of `fused_render_app`**, the same
constraint `formats.py` and `diarize.py` document: every runner reads this on
its own interpreter, with the app's package deliberately off its path.

The model is a STREAMING detector: 512 samples in, one speech probability out,
plus a recurrent state that must be carried to the next window. That is why this
is a loop rather than one array operation, and why `_probabilities` threads
`state` through — passing a fresh state per window silently degrades it to a
frame-energy detector, which is the failure mode that looks like it works.

    speech (31 regions, min 0.8s, median 5.8s, max 14.0s), `large-v3-turbo`
    took 8.32s for the whole file, 23.30s for the 31 raw regions and 9.31s

    `collect_chunks`, which concatenates speech to a maximum duration and remaps
    the timestamps afterwards — and since this module exists so the MLX and CT2
    engines mean the SAME thing by the flag (AI-10f), the two engines sitting
    2.8x apart on it was the parity problem, not a missed optimisation.

    **A region longer than the budget passes through ALONE and is never split.**
    Cutting mid-speech loses the words at the cut, and Whisper already chunks a
    long input internally with its own seeking, which is better at it than a
    boundary chosen here. It travels alone rather than with a neighbour because

    SEGMENT is exempt on purpose — Whisper hears continuous speech across a join
    because the silence is not in the clip it was given, and both sides of that
    join carry real words, so a segment mapped endpoint by endpoint (each end
    through its own region, which is what `original_start`/`original_end` are
    for) is honest. One WORD cannot be spoken across silence this runner cut
    out, and mapping its two ends independently is what made a 0.2s word
    strictly containing a join come back as `4.9-30.1`: a 25-second token that
    freezes a karaoke highlight for the whole dropped pause. Clamping into the
    parent segment does not catch it, because the segment is allowed to straddle
    the same join.

    So a word is placed in ONE region — the one holding its packed MIDPOINT —
    with its interval clamped into that region's packed window. Midpoint rather
    than start, because it puts the word where most of it was actually heard; a
    midpoint landing exactly on a join takes `original_start`'s side (the region
    that BEGINS there), the same tie-break as everywhere else here. For a word
    lying inside one region — every word in a clip with no joins, and the
    overwhelming majority in one with them — this returns the endpoint mapping's
    answer unchanged, a word merely TOUCHING a join at either end included. A
    midpoint past the packed clip (a hallucination timed into the padding)
    resolves to the LAST region and collapses at its bound, which is what the
    endpoint clamp does with the same input.

    A straddling word therefore comes back SHORTER than it was timed — it keeps
    only the part heard inside the region it was placed in — and that is the
    honest answer rather than a shortcoming: the rest of it was timed against
    audio on the other side of a pause the file no longer contains. A highlight
    lets go of the word early; it does not sit on it through the silence.
