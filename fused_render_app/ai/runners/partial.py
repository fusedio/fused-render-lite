"""The progressive transcript: segments on disk as they are decoded (SPEC §41).

`fused.ai.transcribe` writes its `.json` and `.txt` once, at the end. On a
90-minute recording that is a page watching a clock for twenty minutes with
nothing to show. This module is the second file that fixes it: a
`<out_base>.partial.jsonl` beside the output the request already named, one
JSON object per line, appended and **flushed per segment** so anything tailing
it sees whole lines and nothing else.

**Why a file rather than the two channels that already exist.** The job row is
a download-manager record — `done`/`total` and a capped one-line `detail` — and
putting a transcript through it would make every poll carry the whole
accumulated text to every watcher of every row. `worker_base._stream()`'s
chunked NDJSON is the other, and it is what the text runners use, but the
supervisor relays that stream only while the browser holds the connection open;
transcription is deliberately job-shaped, fire-and-forget, outliving the page
that asked and surviving a navigation. A file keeps that property — a tab that
comes back can read what landed while it was gone — and costs the run one
`write` per segment.

**This module is the whole of the feature and it sits at the runners ROOT**,
beside `worker_base.py`, `formats.py` and `diarize.py`, for the reason AI-10c
states: two engines serve one capability and a page must not be able to tell
which one ran. The line shape, the flush rule and the lifecycle exist once, and
`tests/test_ai_partial_transcript.py` pins that structurally — a second
`partial.py` under either runner folder would fail no behavioural test, because
both copies would pass their own.

**Stdlib only, and no import of `fused_render_app`.** The same constraint
`formats.py` and `diarize.py` document, for the same reason (each runner runs
on its own interpreter with the app's package off its path) — plus one of its
own: the server imports this module too, to derive the path it advertises to
the page, and it must not need either runner venv to do that.

**It never mutates the segments it is shown.** They ARE the list the worker is
about to dump, and `diarize.assign_speakers` owns the `speaker` key on it at
the end. The sink labels its own copy of each line, which is what keeps a
transcript's final bytes identical to one written before this existed.
