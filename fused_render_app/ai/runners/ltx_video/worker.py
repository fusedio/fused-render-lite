"""Text-to-video (+ audio) on LTX-2.3, through `ltx-2-mlx` (SPEC §40).

The video engine, and since D468 the only one (see the plan's "ltx-2-mlx,
not mlx-video" decision) — a pure-MLX, MIT-licensed port of LTX-2 that
renders joint audio+video from int4-distilled weights on a 16 GB Mac. It
loads a model INTO its own interpreter, the same shape `mflux_image`'s worker
uses — `ltx_pipelines_mlx.DistilledPipeline` reads MLX safetensors directly
rather than shelling out to a bundled binary.

**Two repos, not one, and both are reported downloads.** `DistilledPipeline`
needs the LTX weights AND a Gemma-3 text encoder it does not ship — upstream's
own default names `mlx-community/gemma-3-12b-it-4bit`, and `download` fetches
that id explicitly (rather than letting the pipeline's own `mlx_lm.load`
reach for it lazily on first render) for the same reason `mlx_whisper/
worker.py` pre-fetches its speech detector: a "Download" that leaves a cache
which cannot work offline has not done the thing the button said it would.
Unlike that VAD prefetch, this one is NOT best-effort — the pipeline cannot
encode a single prompt without it, so a failure here fails the whole
download, exactly like the primary weights repo.

**Only a narrow file set is fetched from the weights repo.** `dgrauet/
ltx-2.3-mlx-q4` (and its byte-identical q8 sibling) also carries a `transformer-
dev.safetensors` (the non-distilled, CFG transformer `DistilledPipeline` never
touches), two `ltx-2.3-22b-distilled-lora-384*.safetensors` (fused into the
NON-distilled two-stage pipeline only — `distilled.py`'s own `load()` loads
the distilled checkpoint directly, no LoRA fusion), and a `spatial_upscaler_
x1_5_v1_0*` / `temporal_upscaler_x2_v1_0*` pair (read by pipelines this build
does not offer). `_curated_file_set` names exactly the files read by
`DistilledPipeline.load()`, `_load_vae_encoder`/`_load_decoders` and
`_load_upsampler` (verified by reading `ltx_pipelines_mlx/_base.py`,
`distilled.py` and `ti2vid_two_stages.py` at the pinned commit) — fetching the
rest would be silent waste.

**Exactly ONE transformer file, chosen from the repo's own LISTING, not a
glob.** `dgrauet/ltx-2.3-mlx-q4` ships BOTH `transformer-distilled.
safetensors` (11.3 GB) AND `transformer-distilled-1.1.safetensors` (the same
11.3 GB again) — `_base.py::_resolve_safetensors` prefers the versioned one,
alphabetically latest, and never opens the other. A pattern like
`"transformer-distilled*.safetensors"` matches BOTH names and `huggingface_
hub` would fetch both — 11.3 GB (q4) to 20.6 GB (q8) of dead weight this
runner would never load. `_resolve_versioned_name` mirrors `_resolve_
safetensors`'s own rule against the Hub's file LISTING instead of a local
directory, so `download` asks for the one file the loader will actually
open — checking the repo's shape before a byte moves.

    it, an unevaluated array is a graph pinned to the stream it was built on,

    no `tqdm` import, no class hierarchy, nothing upstream inspects beyond
    those two things.

    **One instance covers the whole render, not one per `denoise_loop`
    call.** `DistilledPipeline.generate_two_stage` calls `denoise_loop` TWICE
    — stage 1 (`stage1_steps` items) then stage 2's fixed 3-step refine —
    and both go through the same patched name in the same module. The row
    therefore moves twice, restarting at 0 for stage 2: that is the two-stage
    pipeline's own shape (`DistilledPipeline` is inherently two internal
    passes for any request), not a bug in this shim, and it is the same
    "bare done/total, no clock" trade already made for
    its own subprocess's progress lines.

    Ticks BEFORE each step's work rather than after: `tqdm.__iter__` yields
    control back to the loop body immediately, so there is no "step just
    finished" moment to hook without wrapping the loop body itself, which is
    exactly the private, upstream-owned code this shim must not reach into.
    `done=N` therefore reads as "N steps completed so far, about to start the
    next" — the same reading a pre-spawn "step 0/N"
    tick gives its row before a single frame has rendered.
