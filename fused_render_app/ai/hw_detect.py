"""GPU/VRAM detection beyond RAM (SPEC AI-18, D519).

`fit.py` judges a footprint against system RAM only — correct for CPU and
Apple-Silicon unified-memory loads, silently wrong on a discrete CUDA/ROCm
box, where the pool that actually holds the weights is VRAM, a completely
different (usually much smaller) number than `machine_ram_gb()`. This module
is the missing half: per-device VRAM, a device name, multi-GPU aggregation,
and a name -> memory-bandwidth lookup table a future speed-estimate feature
needs.

**Detection is a subprocess probe, and subprocess probes do not belong on the
verdict path.** `fit._wired_limit_mb`'s own docstring states the rule this
module has to keep: a cold `nvidia-smi`/`rocm-smi`/PowerShell spawn is
50-500ms, and `verdict()` runs once per catalog ROW on a route the picker
polls. So the split here is the same one `_wired_limit_mb` drew for the wired
ceiling, at a coarser grain: `detect_hardware()` is the slow probe, `fit.py`
never calls it — see `test_ai_hw_detect.py::
test_fit_module_only_reads_the_cache_never_the_probe`, which greps `fit.py`'s
own source to keep that true. `refresh_hardware()` runs the probe and writes
the result to `~/.fused-render/ai_hardware.json`; `cached_hardware()` is a
plain `storage.read_json` and nothing else — the only thing `fit.py` and
`benchmark.py` are meant to call, once a later phase wires either of them
up to read it.

**Four traps, each with its own test:**

* **Windows `Win32_VideoController.AdapterRAM` is a 32-bit `uint32`.** A card
  with 4GB or more reports the field capped at (or wrapped past) that width —
  a 16GB RTX 4080 comes back as ~4GB. The FIX is not a bigger read of the same
  field: the display driver's own registry key
  (`HKLM\\...\\Class\\{4d36e968-e325-11ce-bfc1-08002be10318}\\<NNNN>\\
  HardwareInformation.qwMemorySize`, Microsoft's documented Display class
  GUID) carries the true value as a 64-bit `REG_QWORD`, so a capped WMI
  reading is re-resolved against that registry value rather than trusted.
  (`Win32_PhysicalMemory` — total SYSTEM ram via SMBIOS — is a different
  number entirely and is used below only for the unified-memory override,
  never as a stand-in for VRAM; an earlier draft of this project's own spec
  conflated the two and this module deliberately does not.)
* **Unified-memory APUs report a tiny carveout, not the real pool.** AMD's
  Ryzen AI Max ("Strix Halo") and NVIDIA's Grace/DGX Spark parts show up as a
  GPU with ~0.5-1GB of "VRAM" — the BIOS-assigned aperture, not the shared
  pool the driver can actually allocate from, which is the whole of system
  RAM. Detected by name (`_apply_unified_override`) and overridden to
  `ram_gb`, exactly like Apple Silicon already is.
* **A cold spawn must never be mistaken for "no GPU".** Every probe here
  degrades to `None` on ANY failure (missing binary, non-zero exit, a
  timeout, malformed output) rather than raising — `detect_hardware` composes
  them with `or`, so one vendor's absence falls through to the next rather
  than aborting the whole probe.
* **A vendor tool is optional, and its output drifts.** "Degrades to None"
  only helps if something else can still answer, and for a long time nothing
  could: an AMD box read as GPU-less if `rocm-smi` was off PATH (ROCm installs
  to `/opt/rocm/bin` and exports nothing), and read as GPU-less AGAIN if it
  ran but title-cased its JSON keys the way ROCm 6 does. Both are now covered
  — the fallback path, a case-insensitive read — and behind them sits
  `_sysfs_gpus`, which needs no vendor package at all because the kernel
  already publishes VRAM under `/sys/class/drm`. The failure this closes is
  not cosmetic: `fit._select_pool` reads "no GPU" as `cpu-only`, so a single
  missing binary made every row in the model catalog claim the machine had no
  accelerator.
