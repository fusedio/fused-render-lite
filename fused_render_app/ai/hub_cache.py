"""Reading — and deleting from — the Hugging Face hub cache on this machine.

This is the whole of what `GET /api/ai-models` and `POST /api/ai-models/delete`
do, minus the two route decorators: the walk that finds every cached repo, the
metadata reading that says what each one IS (task, params, quantization, which
engine could load it), the size arithmetic that makes those numbers mean
"bytes actually on disk", and the deletions that free them.

**It moved out of `server/routers/ai_models.py`, where it was ~1500 lines under
three endpoints.** Two other routers already imported it there —
`ai_runtime.py` for `cached_models`/`cached_capability` (the catalog is built
from what is on disk) and `hub_models.py` for `_scan_repo`/`_revisions`/
`hub_cache_dir` (a search result has to know whether you already have it) — so
the layering was upside down: the module every AI surface reads was reachable
only through one page's router. It belongs beside `catalog.py`, `registry.py`
and `supervisor.py`, which are the other three things that know what a local
model is.

The routes did not move and their URLs did not change.

The cache is a *shared* directory: anything that speaks `huggingface_hub`
(transformers, sentence-transformers, diffusers, a template a user pasted in,
the `hf` CLI) downloads into the same tree, and nothing ever tells the user
what accumulated there or how much disk it is now worth. This module reads that
tree, and — only on an explicit request naming what to remove — deletes from
it.

This module still never FETCHES anything: the download the page now offers
(D258, superseding HS-1) belongs to `ai_runtime.py`, because a fetch is the
runner's — a GGUF image model and an MLX text model do not download the same
set of files. What is here stays the reader and the deleter, so the one module
that walks the cache is not also the one that grows it.

The layout it reads is `huggingface_hub`'s own (CACHE_STRUCTURE in their
docs)::

    <hub cache>/
      models--openai--whisper-small/
        refs/main                 -> a commit sha
        blobs/<sha>               the real bytes
        snapshots/<commit>/…      symlinks back into blobs/
      datasets--squad/
      spaces--user--demo/
      .locks/ version.txt         bookkeeping, skipped

Two consequences drive `_scan_repo`:

* **Size is measured with `lstat`, symlinks skipped.** A snapshot entry points
  at a blob in the *same* repo, so following it would count every file twice
  per revision — a two-revision repo would report triple its real footprint.
  Hardlinks (the same blob shared by two entries, and what Windows falls back
  to when it cannot symlink) are de-duplicated by `(st_dev, st_ino)` for the
  same reason. What is left is bytes actually on disk, which is the number the
  page exists to show.
* **The newest mtime includes the symlinks**, unlike the size — and excludes
  directories. A blob is written once and never touched again, but
  materialising a revision creates its snapshot links, so their mtimes are what
  "last pulled a revision of this repo" actually looks like on disk. Directory
  mtimes are left out because they also move on *deletion*, which would report
  a repo someone just emptied as freshly used.

`atime` rides along beside it for a different question — "when was this last
*read*", which is what pruning by age needs (a model pulled a year ago and
loaded this morning is in use; mtime cannot tell those apart). Only real files
carry it: reading a model through a snapshot symlink updates the BLOB's atime,
not the link's.

Repo ids are decoded the way `huggingface_hub` encodes them — kind prefix,
then the id with `/` written as `--` (`models--openai--whisper-small` ->
`openai/whisper-small`). A directory whose name carries no known kind prefix
is not a repo folder and is skipped, which is also what keeps `.locks/`,
`version.txt` and half-written `tmp*` dirs out of the list.

**Deletion** (`POST /api/ai-models/delete`, D250) carries the D3 `X-Fused`
guard like every other mutating POST, and is deliberately narrow:

* Targets are named by cache **folder name**, never by a path from the client:
  the name is checked to be a single path segment carrying a known kind prefix,
  and joined onto the resolved cache dir here. A path from a request body would
  make this endpoint an arbitrary-rmtree.
* A repo folder that is a **symlink** is refused rather than followed — those
  live on another disk (how people move a 40GB model off the boot volume), and
  deleting through the link would reach outside the directory this endpoint is
  scoped to.
* Deleting a **revision** removes only the blobs that revision alone
  references. A blob shared with another revision survives; refs pointing at
  the deleted commit go with it, since a ref to a revision that no longer
  exists is dangling. If it was the last revision, the repo folder goes too —
  a shell of refs and orphaned blobs is not something to leave behind.
* Every target is reported individually. One stale row must not lose the other
  nine deletions of a prune.

#      the model card came down with the weights there is nothing to infer.

#   3. config_sentence_transformers.json / modules.json — an embedding model.

def _unfinished_fetch(repo_dir: str) -> bool:
    """Whether this repo folder is a download that never finished (D424).

    **POSITIVE EVIDENCE ONLY, and that is the whole design of this predicate.**
    A repo is called partial when something in it is the visible residue of a
    fetch that stopped — never merely because a completion marker is missing.
    The tempting readings all fail on repos that are perfectly complete:

    * **"no `.fused-fetch-<commit>.json` record"** — that record is written only
      by THIS app's fetcher, so every repo pulled by the `hf` CLI, by
      transformers, or by a version of this app older than the record would read
      as half-downloaded.
    * **"no `refs/`"** — a repo pinned at a commit sha has no ref by design
      (neither hf nor `_write_ref` writes one named after a sha), and would read
      the same way.
    * **"nothing here reads the format"** — that is `_engine`'s answer for a
      fully downloaded repo nobody's backend opens (a SigLIP tower, ACE-Step),
      and calling those partial would offer to resume a download that finished
      months ago. The format never enters this question.

    So two facts, both of which are something that IS there:

    1. **A part file in `blobs/`.** Only an interrupted (or in-flight) fetch
       leaves one — our own `finish()` renames the part over the blob and drops
       its sidecar, hf does the same with `.incomplete` — and a live fetch keeps
       rewriting it, so a part file's continued presence is either an in-flight
       download or one nothing has finished cleaning up yet.

       Two different things clean a part file up, on two different schedules,
       and the distinction matters to why this predicate eventually stops
       seeing a repo as partial rather than staying wrong forever.
       `worker_base._clear_parts`, taken only when a segmented fetch gives up
       and falls back to hf, drops OUR part files unconditionally and
       immediately — hf is about to fetch those same names itself. Everything
       else — a recipe whose `allow_patterns` permanently excludes a name an
       earlier, wider fetch already left a part file for — is swept by
       `worker_base._sweep_orphan_parts`, which runs after ANY scope's download
       succeeds (the `_cached_path` fast path included, so a "Continue
       downloading" retry that opens no connection still triggers it) and
       removes any part file — ours or hf's — old enough (past
       `_PART_GRACE_SECONDS`) that it cannot belong to the scope that just
       finished. So a repo this predicate calls partial reads that way until
       the NEXT download attempt of any scope over it succeeds and the
       leftover part file has aged past the grace window — not forever, and not
       on the first retry either, since a part file written moments before a
       retry is presumed to be someone else's in-flight fetch rather than swept
       out from under it.

       A cancel does NOT go through either cleanup path —
       `except Cancelled: raise` skips the fallback, and no download succeeded
       to trigger a sweep — which is exactly why the bytes, and therefore this
       evidence, are still here for a paused download to resume into. That
       lasts only until some OTHER scope's download over the same repo
       succeeds and the grace window passes: the sweep cannot tell a paused
       download's resume state from any other orphan, and clears it too (see
       `worker_base._sweep_orphan_parts`'s docstring for why that trade is
       accepted rather than guarded against).
    2. **No snapshot directory at all.** A folder with blobs and nothing to open,
       which is the state hub search has always called `partial` and the state a
       cancel before the first file lands leaves behind.

    **Not the same number as the folder's size, and the difference is the bug
    this exists for.** Our fetcher PREALLOCATES a part file to the full length of
    the file it is fetching, so a repo 15% of the way through a 1.6GB download
    measures 1.6GB — and a card drawing "how much of this is here" from that read
    as nearly finished while the job row beside it said 243 MB. `_scan_repo` is
    not wrong to count those bytes (the file really is that long, and this page's
    other job is telling you what is eating the disk); they are just not an answer
    to "how much arrived".

    So this is the SCANNED total with one correction applied per part file:
    subtract the length that was counted, add back what is durable. Starting from
    the scan rather than re-adding the blobs is what keeps a finished repo's two
    numbers identical — refs, snapshot entries and any stray file are counted
    once, by the one walk that already knows how to count them.

    Durable, per kind, from the evidence each kind carries:

    * **`.fusedpart`** — the sidecar's segment cursors, the same accounting a
      resume trusts: `flush()` fsyncs the data BEFORE recording an offset, so a
      recorded cursor is always bytes the disk really has (see
      `worker_base._FileFetch.flush`). No sidecar, or an unreadable one, counts
      ZERO rather than the file's length: positive evidence only, the same posture
      `_unfinished_fetch` takes, because the file may be pure preallocation.
    * **`.incomplete`** — `huggingface_hub` APPENDS, so the length already IS the

    itself. `tag` is the vocabulary key those came from, for a caller that wants
    to link to the glossary rather than reprint a sentence.

    `runner_code`/`runner_reason` are `_engine`'s own answer to "which BACKEND
    reads this file", carried past `capability` because a capability CAN be
    shared by runners reading mutually unloadable layouts (video generation

    * the CATALOG field fails closed — `== "dual"`, so an unknown answers False
      and the Playground draws no image mode. `_accepts_image`'s discipline: an
      affordance whose request then 400s is worse than a missing one.
    * the ROUTE refusal fails OPEN — `== "text"`, so it refuses only on positive
      evidence that there is no vision tower. A cold model has no snapshot to
      read, and a `paths` call on one must still answer `model_loading` and
      start the download, exactly as it does today; turning that into a 400
      would break a working call on the strength of a file not being there yet.
