"""`~/.fused-render/models.json` — a user-extensible overlay on
`catalog.SUGGESTIONS` (SPEC AI-25, D529).

**Follows `server/templates.py`'s registry idiom exactly** (SPEC CT-5/CT-6,
D73), because that module already answered every question this one would
otherwise have to re-derive: read the file fresh on every call rather than
caching it (a tiny local JSON file, so an edit applies on the next request
with no restart and no cache-invalidation story to get wrong — the same
reasoning `_load_registry`'s own docstring states), a missing file is a
CLEAN no-op rather than an error (`FileNotFoundError` -> `None`, not raised),
and a malformed one degrades SILENTLY to "no overlay" rather than taking the
AI Models page down — a curated catalog with a typo'd `models.json` sitting
beside it must still render the built-in list, the same way a broken
`templates/registry.json` still lets a file open with its built-in binding.

**The merge rule** (SPEC item 15's own words, sharpened by code review
finding 4): an overlay entry whose `id` matches a built-in row's `id` is
SHALLOW-MERGED over it, field by field, at the SAME POSITION in the list
(`catalog.py`'s lists are ordered smallest-first, and overriding a row's
`size_gb` should not also silently reorder the page); an entry whose `id`
names nothing built-in APPENDS as-is. Both are keyed by RUNNER CODE, the
same grain `catalog.SUGGESTIONS` itself uses, so `{"llamacpp-text": [...]}`
in `models.json` only ever touches that one curated list.

**Shallow-merged, not replaced wholesale — this was the module's own bug
until code review finding 4.** The docstring's motivating example
(overriding a row's `size_gb`) is exactly what a wholesale replace breaks:
`{"id": "a/b", "size_gb": 9.0}` used to REPLACE the built-in row entirely,
silently dropping `label`/`note`/`params`/`quantization`/`recommended` —
and `params`/`quantization` specifically feed `fit.verdict`/`speed.
estimate_tok_s`, so a user overriding a download size for accuracy was
rewarded with a WORSE fit/speed estimate (params-less, quant-less) than
the row they started from. A field named in the overlay entry still wins
outright; only fields the overlay entry omits fall through to the
built-in row's own value.

**Field REMOVAL is not supported, and that is deliberate scope, not an
oversight.** A user who wants a built-in field gone entirely (rather than
overridden) has no way to express that in this merge — `null` in JSON
already means Python `None`, a real value some fields legitimately hold
(a row's own `note` can be absent), so treating it as a delete sentinel
would be ambiguous rather than a clean convention, and nothing in this
build's scope needs it: every curated field is either safe to leave at
its built-in value or worth overriding with a real replacement, never
worth erasing outright. If a future need for it materializes, the honest
fix is a dedicated marker (e.g. a reserved sentinel string, not bare
`null`), not a silent overload of an existing JSON value.

**Not machine-scoped, unlike `footprints.py`.** A user's hand-curated model
row is a statement about what THEY want offered, not a fact about the
machine that happened to write the file — carrying it onto a new machine (or
reading it from a synced dotfiles setup) is the whole point of it living in
the home directory at all.

Wired into exactly one call site, `catalog.for_runner` — every other reader
of `SUGGESTIONS` (`for_capability`, `all_suggested_ids`, `runners_offering`,
...) already goes through it, so the overlay is visible everywhere the
built-in curation is without a second wiring point to keep in sync.
