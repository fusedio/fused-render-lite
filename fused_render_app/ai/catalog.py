"""Which models to suggest, per runner (SPEC §40).

These lists used to live inside the apps — `local_chat/chat.py` carried three
MLX text models and `flux_text2image/worker.py` hard-coded one image model. That
put the curation in the wrong place twice over: a second chat app had to copy it,
and the AI Models page — the one surface whose whole job is "what should I have
on this disk" — could not see it at all.

**Curated, not fetched.** The Hub has half a million models and a `downloads`
sort is a popularity contest; what a user needs on a laptop is a handful that are
known to fit and known to work with the runner that will load them. That is an
editorial judgement, so it is a list a person maintains, with the reason written
down beside each entry.

**Keyed by RUNNER, not by capability, and that is what makes it correct on more
than one platform.** A suggestion is only meaningful for the backend that will
load it: `mlx-community/Qwen3.5-9B-MLX-4bit` is packed for Metal kernels and is
unloadable rubbish on a Windows box, while `Qwen/Qwen3.5-4B` is the
right answer there and the wrong one on a Mac that has MLX. One capability with
two BACKENDS (text generation since D293, speech to text since D302) therefore
has two lists — hardware variants of one backend share theirs, since the wheel
changes and the readable format does not (`_SHARED_SUGGESTIONS`) — and the
registry's resolution decides which one a machine sees, the same mechanism
asked the same question, so the page cannot offer a model the loader would then
refuse.

**Which means the suggestion list CAN move when a PREFERENCE moves**, not only
when the hardware differs: a user who switches speech to text from MLX to
CTranslate2 on the Preferences page is shown four different repos next time they
open the AI Models page, and the ones they may already have downloaded stop
being offered. That is correct — a suggestion is only meaningful for the backend
that will load it — but it must not be silent, which is why `describe()` reports
the resolved runner's LABEL beside every list and the page shows it.

**"Can", because since the per-hardware split some engine switches move the
label and leave the list exactly where it is.** CPU -> CUDA -> ROCm is a change
of wheel, not of weights format, so those rows share one list by construction
(`_SHARED_SUGGESTIONS`) and the page correctly shows the same repos under a new
engine name. The rule underneath is unchanged and is the one to reason from: the
list belongs to the FORMAT a backend reads, and it moves when and only when that
format does.

Sizes are the on-disk download, and the notes are frank about the trade — which
since the per-hardware runner split means frank about the MODEL and never about
the machine: one list is shown by three engines (CPU, CUDA, ROCm), and a note
saying "tight on 16GB" would mean system RAM under one of them and VRAM under
the others. `size_gb` is the field that answers the budget question, in the one
unit this file defines; see the rules stated above `SUGGESTIONS` itself.

**`size_gb` IS EVERY BYTE THE DOWNLOAD FETCHES, ACROSS EVERY REPO IT TOUCHES.**
Not the weights file, not the interesting part, not one of the two repos — the
whole of what appears on the disk when the user presses Download, in decimal GB.
The diffusers FLUX entry said 2.6 for eighteen months of reading, because 2.6 is
what its GGUF transformer weighs, while the pull also brought the base repo's
text encoder and VAE: the true figure was 18.6 (D308). The mflux entry beside it
has always meant the whole snapshot. Two adjacent lists whose field means
different things is a silent ordering bug the moment either gains a second
entry, because the rule below sorts and DEFAULTS on this number.

**ONE ORDERING RULE: SMALLEST FIRST, AND THE DEFAULT FOLLOWS POSITION 0.** Every
list here is sorted by ascending `size_gb`, and `default_for()` returns
`entries[0]["id"]` — so what a bare `fused.ai.transcribe()` or `fused.ai.image()`
loads is simply the smallest model the resolved runner offers. Entries with no
`size_gb` (none today) sort LAST: an unknown download is the one thing that must
not be promoted into the "safe, small, starts quickly" slot.

**The cost of that rule is deliberate and was chosen by the user with the
trade-off in front of them (2026-08-16).** A no-model call now gets the LEAST
ACCURATE model rather than the recommended one — `Systran/faster-whisper-tiny.en`
instead of `deepdml/faster-whisper-large-v3-turbo-ct2`, and the smallest text
entry instead of the strongest one (`Qwen/Qwen3.5-4B` rather than
`Qwen/Qwen3.5-9B` after the 2026-08-21 refresh; the pair the user was actually
shown was `Qwen/Qwen3-1.7B` against `Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507`, both since
retired, which is why the rule is stated in terms of POSITION and not of
names). The alternative — a separate `default: True`
field, so the list could be ordered one way and the default picked another — was
offered and rejected: one rule that a reader can verify by eye beats two that can
silently disagree. **Do not "fix" this back** by reordering a list so the good
model leads, and do not reintroduce a default field; a smallest-first list whose
head is also the default is the intended design, not a sorting accident.

from fused_render_app.ai import registry

#: runner code -> suggested models, SMALLEST FIRST (see the ordering rule in the
#: module docstring; position 0 is also the default). `size_gb` is the approximate
#: download in decimal GB — EVERY repo and every file the Download fetches, summed
#: from the Hub's per-file byte metadata and rounded to one decimal, never the
#: headline weights alone. **None when that metadata is unavailable**,
#: which the card shows as "—" rather than inventing a figure from parameter
#: counts (the same no-guess rule the Hub result cards follow, D255/D295).
#: `note` is why you would or would not pick this one.
#: `nickname` is the short human name the Playground sidebar shows — the model
#: without its quantization/engine qualifier and WITHOUT ITS PARAMETER COUNT,
#: which the card prints beside it as a chip: "Qwen3.5", not "Qwen3.5 4B". The
#: name and the chip repeating each other was the whole reason to state the
#: rule here. It goes further where the full name is jargon rather than a name
#: — both Liquid rows read "Liquid 2.5" where the labels say "LFM2.5 1.2B
#: Instruct" and "LFM2.5 8B-A1B", because the acronym and the instruct-tuning
#: distinguish nothing on a tab where every text row is chat-tuned.
#:
#: So SIBLINGS OF ONE FAMILY SHARE A NICKNAME on purpose (two "Liquid 2.5", two
#: "Qwen3.5"), and the chip is what tells them apart. That only holds while
#: every colliding row HAS a `params` — a family whose rows would collide with
#: no distinguishing chip must keep the size in the name. What is not a
#: parameter count stays: Whisper's tiny/small/large-v3 and SigLIP2's `base`
#: are the publisher's own variant names, and the chip says 39M beside them.
#: A curated FIELD, never
#: derived by stripping the label's parenthetical at runtime, for the reason
#: `short_label` and `family_label` are fields too (AI-2c): a stripped name
#: is a value nobody owns and no test can see.
#: `params` and `quantization` are the two facts the Playground's stage header
#: prints beside the size — parameter count as the publisher states it ("4B",
#: "8B (~1B active)", "4B effective") and the quantization scheme by its own
#: name. Curated fields for the same AI-2c reason as `nickname`: parsing them
#: out of a repo id breaks on the first ternary, MoE or effective-size entry.
#: Both optional — an entry whose scheme has no honest short name (the plain
#: MLX/CT2 Whisper conversions, the embeddings encoders) omits `quantization`
#: rather than inventing one, and the header omits the line.
#:
#: **`recommended` IS A SECOND AXIS, AND IT IS THE ONLY ONE THE PLAYGROUND
#: READS.** Opt-in, absent almost everywhere: every entry here is a model this
#: app stands behind on the AI Models page, and the marked one is what the
#: Playground offers — recommended-or-downloaded is what its sidebar draws
#: (D425). The two surfaces want different lengths for the same curation. The AI
#: Models page is a place to SHOP: five text entries from 0.7GB to 20GB is the
#: range someone comparing downloads needs, and its Local tab exists to say what
#: a disk already holds. The Playground is a place to TRY, reached by someone who
#: wants to type a sentence and see what comes back — and a sidebar of five
#: rows, most of them a multi-gigabyte download away from answering, is a
#: decision where a text box was wanted.
#:
#: **TWO ROWS MINIMUM, FIVE MAXIMUM, PER LIST — and a test pins both ends.**
#: A list is what ONE machine sees, so the bounds are per runner and not a
#: total. The FLOOR is about having somewhere to go: a single-row list reads as
#: a shortlist and behaves as a mandate, and the reader whose first image or
#: first answer is not good enough has no second thing to click and no way to
#: tell whether the model or the prompt was the problem. The CEILING is about
#: being read at all: these lists are swept, not studied, and past five cards
#: the rows stop being answers and become a research task — which is the same
#: argument `recommended` won one row at a time, applied to the page that
#: shortlist sits on.
#:
#: **The bounds are a budget, not a target.** Filling a list to five with rows
#: that differ only in size is worse than a list of three where every row
#: answers a different question, and the rule a row still has to pass is this
#: file's own: it is SOMEBODY'S answer — the smallest thing that works, the
#: strongest thing that fits, a second publisher to try when the first one
#: reads a prompt badly, an architecture that changes what a size means. A row
#: that is only "the one above but bigger" is what the ceiling is for.
#:
#: **EXACTLY ONE PER LIST — one per capability AND engine, since that is what a
#: list IS — and a test pins the count both ways.** Not "a handful", which is
#: what this started as (three of the eight text entries, two of the four MLX
#: whispers) and which was the owner's call to cut: a shortlist of three is still
#: a comparison, and the reader who came to type a sentence has no way to make
#: it. One row is an ANSWER. It also makes the flag's meaning checkable by eye —
#: "the model to try on this engine" has one correct value per list, where "a
#: good first click" had as many as somebody felt like marking. The floor and the
#: ceiling matter for different reasons: no marked entry leaves the Playground's
#: group empty on a machine with nothing downloaded, and two puts the choice back.
#:
#: **It is NOT "the best one", and it is NOT the default.** `default_for()` is
#: still position 0, still the smallest, and a recommended entry has no bearing
#: on it — see the module docstring on why there is no `default: True` field and
#: why reintroducing one under this name would be the same mistake wearing a new
#: word. What the flag means is "the one to TRY on this engine": strong enough
#: that a first answer is a fair picture of what local inference does here, small
#: enough that the download is not the experience.
#:
#: **Where that lands is per LIST and is nobody's formula.** On the text lists it
#: is neither end — the smallest entry is quick and weaker than every row above
#: it, and a 20GB model can be the best row in its list and still be a poor first
#: click. On `mlx-whisper` it IS the head: a 0.05GB tiny.en downloads in seconds
#: and transcribes clear speech well enough to show what the feature does, which
#: is exactly the "the download is not the experience" half of the rule winning
#: outright. So the marked entry sometimes coincides with `default_for()` and
#: sometimes does not, and that is not a bug either way — the two axes are
#: independent, not opposed, and nothing may derive one from the other. Note that
#: the two whisper lists disagree today (MLX marks tiny.en, CTranslate2 marks
#: turbo); an engine's list is its own editorial judgement, so that is allowed
#: rather than a drift to reconcile.
#:
#: **ONE LINE EACH.** A shortlist is read by SWEEPING it, and four cards of three
#: sentences is a wall nobody reaches the end of — so each note carries the
#: single thing that would change the choice and stops, with the rest left to
#: the model card the name links to. The oldest lists here predate the rule and
#: still run to three sentences.
#:
#: **THE NOTES ARE HARDWARE-NEUTRAL, and that is a rule rather than a style.**
#: A list is shown by every hardware variant of its runner (`_SHARED_SUGGESTIONS`),
#: so a note that mentions a device is wrong on all but one of them: "the one to
#: pick with no GPU" is a tautology on the CPU row, and "the only one that needs
#: a GPU" reads as "do not pick this" inside a list whose only purpose is to be
#: picked from. A memory claim is worse than wrong, it is ambiguous — "fits a
#: 16GB machine" means SYSTEM RAM on the CPU row and VRAM on the accelerated
#: ones, which are different numbers on the same physical machine, and on ROCm
#: they are not even the number on the box (pytorch#184880 has a 16GB RX 9060 XT
#: reporting ~7915MB usable). **`size_gb` carries the budget question**, in the
#: one unit this file defines — every byte the download fetches — and a reader
#: comparing it against their own machine is doing arithmetic these sentences
#: cannot do for them.
#:
#: Both rules were written above the `transformers-text` list and are stated here
#: because D416 removed it: a rule that lives inside one entry of a table is a
#: rule that disappears when that entry does, and four other lists cite it.
SUGGESTIONS: dict[str, list[dict]] = {
    # Refreshed 2026-08-16, and the refresh brought one fact this list has not
    # had to state before.
    #
    # **EVERY QWEN AND GEMMA CHECKPOINT HERE IS MULTIMODAL, AND HALF OF IT IS
    # DEAD WEIGHT** — the LFM2.5 entry at position 0 is the exception, and it
    # is the first entry this list has ever had that pays none of this cost:
    # `Lfm2ForCausalLM`, no `vision_config`, every byte fetched is a byte the
    # language model uses. Qwen3.5, Qwen3.6 and gemma-4 all ship as
    # `…ForConditionalGeneration` with a `vision_config` (gemma-4 adds an
    # `audio_config`), and mlx-lm loads the LANGUAGE TOWER and nothing else —
    # the vision and audio weights sit in the snapshot, downloaded and unused,
    # until an `mlx-vlm` runner exists to use them. It is not avoidable by
    # shopping around: there is no text-only conversion of Qwen3.5 on the Hub,
    # every 4-bit variant of it measured the same. So the sizes below are
    # honest about the download and quietly larger than a text-only model of
    # the same class, and under this file's own "sized for the machine that
    # will actually run them" rule that is a real cost paid on every entry.
    #
    # **OptiQ quants where they exist, and ONE ENTRY PER BASE MODEL.** The
    # `-OptiQ-4bit` repos are mixed precision: a sensitivity pass puts the
    # layers that need it at 8-bit and leaves the rest at 4-bit, written as a
    # per-layer map in the config's `quantization` dict. That is ordinary
    # mlx-lm mixed-precision format — they load on the runner as it ships, with
    # no new package and no pyproject change — and they are tagged
    # `text-generation`, while the `-MLX-4bit` siblings they replace are
    # `mlx-vlm` conversions tagged `image-text-to-text` whose own model cards
    # say a better conversion may exist elsewhere. Listing both would put one
    # base model on the page twice, distinguished by a suffix a reader cannot
    # interpret, which is a worse shortlist rather than a longer one.
    #
    # **The OptiQ premium is real and the model cards understate it.** They say
    # "within ~5% of a stock uniform 4-bit quant"; measured on the Qwen3.5 9B
    # conversion, `-OptiQ-4bit` is 8.22GB against the uniform conversion's
    # 5.98GB, which is 37% — 132 of its 248 layers sit at 8-bit, and a
    # multi-token-prediction file (~0.19GB) and a higher-precision vision tower
    # ride along. Every `size_gb` on an OptiQ row here is the measured figure
    # rather than the uniform quant's, because a user picking "the better one"
    # and finding two extra gigabytes downloading is the surprise this column
    # exists to prevent.
    # Their configs also carry keys mlx-lm ignores (`mtp_file`, `optiq_vision`,
    # `mlx_lm_extra_tensors`); nothing here reads them, and the `group_size`
    # and `bits` that `runners/formats.py` keys on are present at the top level
    # exactly as in a uniform quant — checked, not assumed.
    #
    # **Both `mlx-community/gemma-4-12B-it-4bit` and its OptiQ sibling are
    # deliberately absent**, and they are the entries a future reader is most
    # likely to try to add: newer than everything here, ungated, and the plain
    # one is — measured, not assumed — 1.3GB SMALLER than the Gemma 3 12B this
    # list used to carry. Neither loads. Their `model_type` is `gemma4_unified`,
    # mlx-lm resolves a checkpoint by importing `mlx_lm.models.<model_type>`,
    # and 0.31.3 ships `gemma4.py` and `gemma4_text.py` and no
    # `gemma4_unified.py` — so the load ends in "Model type gemma4_unified not
    # supported." The `e4b`/`e2b` siblings ARE `gemma4` and do load — they
    # are addable the moment a Gemma row earns one of the five slots, and
    # today all five go elsewhere on the size ladder. Recheck when mlx-lm
    # is next bumped.
    #
    # Ordered SMALLEST FIRST, like every list in this file, which means the
    # 0.7GB LFM2.5 1.2B leads and is what a no-model chat call loads — see the
    # module docstring for why that trade was taken deliberately. Sizes are the
    # whole-snapshot Hub byte sum on 2026-08-16 (D295), the LFM2.5 row's
    # re-measured on 2026-08-21, and every entry is ungated. **One line each**,
    # and each note names the entry it compares itself to rather than saying
    # "above"/"below", so a future size correction that moves a row does not
    # quietly falsify the prose.
    "mlx-text": [
        # Position 0, replacing `mlx-community/Qwen3.5-2B-MLX-4bit` (1.7GB),
        # and it is a straight win rather than a trade: 2.6x less to fetch,
        # text-only where the Qwen 2B spent part of that on a vision tower
        # mlx-lm drops, and the same model the `llamacpp-text` list leads with
        # — so the two platforms now start a bare `fused.ai()` on the SAME
        # model rather than on two different compromises.

        # be tried here, because MLX does not install off Apple Silicon and
        # the refresh that added it was done on Linux. What WAS checked is the
        # exact resolution step the `gemma4_unified` paragraph above turns on:
        # `model_type` is `lfm2`, mlx-lm resolves a checkpoint by importing
        # `mlx_lm.models.<model_type>`, and 0.31.3's wheel ships `lfm2.py`
        # (read out of the published wheel, not assumed). Its `quantization`
        # block is a plain uniform `{group_size: 64, bits: 4, mode: affine}`
        # with no `quant_method`, so `formats.unloadable_quant` passes it the
        # same way it passes every other row here. Someone on a Mac should
        # still load it once.

    # pair — see that module's docstring for why this is not a `repo:quant`
    # grammar. **That is also why Hub search cannot populate this list**: the
    # Discover tab's search hands back a bare repo id, this runner has no rule
    # for picking one file out of thirty, and only the ids curated here ever
    # load — the same limitation `formats.COMPONENT_REPOS`'s repos already
    # have, for the same reason.
    #
    # **Every entry's `general.architecture` is checked against
    # `formats.GGUF_TEXT_ARCHITECTURES` BEFORE it is listed, and then the file
    # is actually LOADED.** The metadata check is cheap and catches the wrong
    # class of model; it does not prove that the June 2026 llama.cpp this
    # runner vendors can build an August 2026 checkpoint of a family whose
    # NAME it knows. That gap is exactly the trap the `mlx-text` list above
    # documents for `gemma4_unified`, so every entry ADDED here was loaded
    # through `llamacpp_text/.venv`'s own `llama_cpp.Llama` and asked for a
    # token before it went in (2026-08-21, llama-cpp-python 0.3.29): LFM2.5
    # 1.2B (`lfm2`), Qwen3.5 4B Q4_K_M (`qwen35`), Gemma 4 E4B (`gemma4`) and
    # LFM2.5 8B-A1B (`lfm2moe`) each answered. The 27B row carries over from the previous shortlist
    # UNCHANGED and was not re-loaded for this refresh — 13GB to re-verify a
    # file that was already shipping. Redo the loads when the pin in
    # `llamacpp_text/pyproject.toml` moves; an arch name in the table is a
    # necessary condition, never a sufficient one.
    #
    # **Three publishers over five rows, and that is a REQUIREMENT of the list
    # rather than a coincidence of what was newest.** This list was five Qwen
    # entries over three Qwen repos: two of them the same 4B at two
    # quantizations, two of them the same 9B. A shortlist whose every row
    # shares a tokenizer, a training mix and a failure mode gives a user
    # nothing to try when the first answer is bad — "measure it against a
    # model you already trust" is advice the MLX list can give because it has
    # Gemma beside Qwen, and this one could not. Now: Liquid, Qwen and Google.
    #
    # **Liquid appears twice, and the second one is not a duplicate.** The
    # 1.2B at position 0 and the 8B-A1B below it are a dense model and a
    # mixture of experts — the same publisher, and nothing else in common that
    # matters to a picker. Where a repeated Qwen 4B at two quantizations gave
    # a reader one choice wearing two labels, these two answer different
    # questions ("the smallest thing that works" and "8B answers at 1B
    # speed"), which is the test a row has to pass to be here.
    #
    # **And that requirement is load-bearing precisely BECAUSE of D416.** Since
    # the transformers family was withdrawn, this list is what a bare "auto"
    # reaches on Windows and Linux rather than an opt-in a user had to go
    # looking for — so these four entries are no longer an alternative
    # shortlist beside a safetensors one, they are the whole of what text
    # generation suggests on those platforms. A monoculture was a thin
    # shortlist when it was the second list; it is the only list now.
    #
    # **The Qwen entries are still current-generation, which is the thing that
    # made the old monoculture defensible.** llama.cpp converts and runs the
    # TEXT TOWER of the `Qwen3_5ForConditionalGeneration` family — the same
    # language model the removed `transformers-text` list served in full bf16
    # precision, at 19.3GB for the 9B (D416) — so a machine too small for that
    # download still runs the same model's answers at a fraction of the size,
    # not a smaller model wearing the same name.
    #
    # Sizes verified against the Hub's `?blobs=true` metadata on 2026-08-21,
    # summing ONLY the one GGUF file `download_file` fetches (never the whole
    # repo) plus nothing else — a GGUF carries its own vocabulary, config and
    # chat template inside the one file, so there is no second download to add
    # in whatever else sits beside it in the repo (the LFM2.5 repo ships a
    # `leap/` directory of runtime manifests and the gemma repo a `config.json`
    # and an `MTP/` folder; none of it is fetched, see
    # `runners/llama_text.py`). Every file checked is a single
    # root-level `.gguf`, not a `-00001-of-0000N` shard — `download_file` takes
    # one filename, so a sharded tier would have been silently unloadable and
    # was excluded before it could ship (the 27B repo's own BF16 tier IS
    # sharded, which is one reason its shortlist entry is the aggressively
    # quantized UD-Q3_K_XL rather than anything closer to full precision).
    # Every repo checked `gated: false`.
    #
    # **The "no text model under 4B" rule is deliberately broken at position 0,
    # and only there.** That rule was written against 2025-era 1-3B models and
    # it is the right default still — but position 0 is not a recommendation,
    # it is what a bare `fused.ai()` loads on a machine whose owner never
    # opened this page, and on the CPU wheel that is most non-Apple machines.
    # A 2.7GB download that answers at a few tokens a second is a worse first
    # experience than a 0.7GB one that answers immediately, and LFM2.5 is not a
    # small transformer — Liquid's hybrid short-convolution stack is built for
    # CPU decode, which is the case this engine actually defaults into. The
    # `mlx-text` list above leads with the SAME model for the same reason, so
    # the two platforms now start a no-model call on one model rather than on
    # two different compromises. Every OTHER row here obeys the rule.

    # and not only a hardware fact. Switching the engine on the Preferences page
    # changes this list, which is correct and must not be silent; the page says
    # so (`describe`'s `runnerLabel`).
    #
    # Sizes use the same full-snapshot Hub metadata estimate as the lists above
    # (2026-08-15; small and turbo re-measured 2026-09-01, see below).
    # **One line each**, per `SUGGESTIONS`' own rule: a shortlist is read by
    # sweeping it.
    #
    # **No medium.** It weighs about what large-v3 turbo weighs and turbo is
    # better at every language, so a medium row would be an entry that is never
    # the right pick — a shortlist earns its length by every line being
    # somebody's answer.

    # **2026-09-01: small and turbo now point at their `-q4` conversions**,
    # closing a gap this list had carried since it was first written — tiny.en
    # was the only quantized row, so the one entry small enough not to need it
    # was the one that had it, and the two rows big enough to actually benefit
    # did not. `mlx-community/whisper-small-mlx-q4` and
    # `…/whisper-large-v3-turbo-q4` are ONE-FILE snapshots (`weights.npz` plus
    # the usual config/readme) exactly like the fp16 repos they replace, so the
    # size drop is real and not an artifact of counting fewer files: measured
    # via the Hub API's per-file `blobs=true` byte sizes on 2026-09-01, small
    # goes from 0.4813GB to 0.1965GB and turbo from 1.6140GB to 0.4637GB — both
    # rounded the way this file rounds throughout. Both configs carry a plain
    # `{"group_size": 64, "bits": 4}` block, the same shape `tiny.en-8bit` has
    # always loaded on this runner, so nothing about `load()`'s format check or
    # its `mx.float16` priming (which is `transcribe()`'s own `fp16` decode
    # default, not a per-model choice) changes for these two.
    #
    # **REPLACED, not added beside — a deliberate trade and not a saving on
    # curation effort.** Doubling this list to six rows so every model appears
    # in both precisions would make the list itself the thing nobody reads
    # (`SUGGESTIONS`' own "sweeping it" rule), and — the harder cost — 4-bit
    # Whisper carries a real word-error-rate penalty the model cards do not
    # quantify and this repo cannot measure (no Apple Silicon in this
    # environment; the two sizes above are Hub metadata, not a benchmark). That
    # cost is accepted here because it mirrors the trade every OTHER list in
    # this file already makes: `mlx-text` ships OptiQ/4-bit rows exclusively,
    # `faster-whisper` line below ships CTranslate2's int8 throughout, and nothing
    # here keeps an fp16 CHAT model beside its quantized replacement either — a
    # shortlist that quantizes some rows and not others is the inconsistency
    # this change closes, not one it should introduce a second way. `large-v3`
    # below is kept UNQUANTIZED on purpose, for a different and repo-specific
    # reason — see its own note — so the accuracy ceiling of this list has not
    # actually dropped, only its middle two rows have.
    #
    # **`mlx-community/whisper-large-v3-mlx-4bit` was checked and excluded.**
    # Its config passes the same format and quantization checks as the two rows
    # above (`n_mels`/`n_audio_ctx`/`n_vocab` present, `weights.npz` with a
    # plain 4-bit `quantization` block), but its snapshot ALSO carries a
    # `model.safetensors` the exact size of its `weights.npz` (0.9736GB each,
    # per the same 2026-09-01 Hub query) — a second, unused copy of the same
    # weights in a different container, the identical "half of it is dead
    # weight" shape the `mlx-text` list documents for the Qwen/Gemma vision
    # towers. `download()` fetches the whole snapshot with no
    # `allow_patterns`, so `size_gb` for this repo is the sum, 1.9467GB — MORE
    # than turbo-q4 (0.4637GB) for accuracy turbo already claims to match, and
    # not meaningfully less than the unquantized `large-v3-mlx` row below
    # (3.0835GB) once the wasted file is counted. A row that costs more to
    # download than the answer already in this list, for the same claimed
    # accuracy, is not a row worth adding regardless of the ordering rule —
    # this is the `no medium` reasoning above applied to a repo instead of a
    # size class.
    #
    # Ordering unaffected: every size below FELL, none crossed a neighbour, so
    # `default_for()` returns `tiny.en-8bit` at position 0 — see the module
    # docstring on why that is checked explicitly rather than assumed.

    # Embeddings on MLX. TWO SHAPES, and they come from two different kinds of
    # repo for one reason: which account publishes a SINGLE-FORMAT build of the
    # thing this engine reads.
    #
    # * The `google/siglip2-*` upstream safetensors are used where no
    #   `mlx-community` build is BETTER, not as a rule. mlx-embeddings' own
    #   SigLIP port reads `model.safetensors` beside a `"model_type": "siglip"`
    #   config directly, so an upstream repo needs no conversion to work — which
    #   makes the conversion worth taking only when it buys something. For
    #   so400m it buys half the download at the same capability (bf16 against
    #   upstream fp32) and it is taken; for the base row the only conversion on
    #   offer is 224px and 8-bit, a weaker model, and it is not.
    # * The PROSE row is an `mlx-community` conversion, because that is where a
    #   single-format MLX build of a prose encoder exists at all. The upstream
    #   `nomic-ai/*` repos ship an ONNX export and (for some) an OpenVINO copy
    #   beside their safetensors, so this list's whole-snapshot convention would
    #   charge four or five times the weights for one; the conversion ships MLX
    #   safetensors and tokenizer files and nothing else, so the convention costs
    #   nothing there. That is also the re-upload convention every other MLX row
    #   in this file already follows.
    #
    # `size_gb` is the WHOLE snapshot for all three, this file's ordinary
    # convention — each of these repos publishes one format, so the whole-repo
    # pull IS the fetched set. (The ONNX block below documents why it has to
    # deviate.) Hub per-file byte sums, 2026-08-25. All three ungated;
    # Apache-2.0.
    #
    # **The prose row leads, so a Mac's default is a paragraph encoder too** —
    # 0.30 GB against the ONNX default's 0.55, with four times the context.
    #
    # **Cross-engine vector comparability is NOT a goal of this table, and this
    # paragraph used to say the opposite.** It claimed the two engines' rows were
    # matched so a page's vectors would survive an engine switch, and it told the
    # next reader not to "optimize" the bigger row. That was a real constraint
    # once and it has been withdrawn: nobody is asked to move an index between a
    # Mac and a Linux box, and holding both lists to the intersection of what the
    # two engines can read cost real download size for a promise no one wanted.
    # Each engine now curates the best build IT can read.
    #
    # What DOES matter, and is a live hazard, is provenance WITHIN one engine.
    # Two models on the same list can share a dimension — `onnx-embed`'s nomic
    # default and its SigLIP2 base row are both 768 — so vectors indexed under
    # one and queried under the other have the same shape, no error, and
    # different meanings. There is nothing this table can do about that: the fix
    # is that `/api/ai/embed` returns the `model` it used and a caller stores it
    # beside the vectors. `skills/fused-render-ai/SKILL.md` states that rule, and
    # it is the reason the field exists.
    #
    # **Every curated row has a KNOWN PROMPT SCHEME**, the same curation rule the
    # ONNX block states. The prose row needed an explicit

    # **What is deliberately NOT here, and why**, because each of these is a

    # * `mlx-community/bge-small-en-v1.5-bf16` (0.07 GB) and
    #   `mlx-community/multilingual-e5-small-mlx` (0.25 GB). Both LOAD — `bert`
    #   is in the gate — and both would take position 0 on size, which under the
    #   smallest-first rule makes them the default. One is English-only and both
    #   cap at 512 tokens, so either would make a Mac's default the weakest model
    #   in this list for the job the capability exists for. The identical
    #   structural argument keeps bge off the ONNX list.
    # * `mlx-community/embeddinggemma-300m-bf16` (0.65 GB) and
    #   `mlx-community/Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B-8bit` (0.65 GB). These do NOT load:
    #   `gemma3_text` and `qwen3` are not in `formats.MLX_EMBED_MODEL_TYPES`, and
    #   that set is deliberately narrower than mlx-embeddings' module list — a
    #   decoder-derived embedder wears its CHAT architecture's `model_type`, so
    #   admitting it would route every Qwen3 chat checkpoint on the disk to this
    #   runner. Both schemes are already in `TEXT_EMBED_PROMPTS`, which makes
    #   them look one line from ready; the gate is what blocks them, not the
    #   prompts.
    # * `mlx-community/nomicai-modernbert-embed-base-4bit` (0.09 GB), the same
    #   model a third the size. Quantization costs retrieval quality and costs it
    #   into the VECTOR, where there is no sampling step afterwards to absorb it
    #   — the same class of silent loss the prompt table guards against. bf16 is
    #   the honest default; the 4-bit build is a fine thing to fetch by hand.
    # * `mlx-community/siglip2-base-patch16-224-8bit` (the base row's only
    #   `mlx-community` counterpart). NOT a cheaper build of
    #   `google/siglip2-base-patch16-384`: it is 224px and 8-BIT, a weaker model
    #   on both axes rather than the same one converted. The so400m row above
    #   took the conversion precisely because that one IS the same capability at
    #   half the bytes (bf16 against fp32); this one is not, so the base row
    #   stays upstream. The two decisions are consistent, not contradictory —
    #   the question each time is "same model, cheaper build?" and here the
    #   answer is no.

    # Embeddings — `onnx-community`'s ONNX Runtime exports of the two
    # `google/siglip2-*` checkpoints above. The safetensors were served here by

    # encoder is one forward pass over a short sequence or one image, so the
    # compute was never the argument — the WHEEL was, at 0.2 GB on the CPU index
    # and up to 5.9 GB on an accelerated one to run a model whose own weights
    # are 1.5 GB, where `onnxruntime` is tens of megabytes.
    #
    # **Two embeddings blocks, and `mlx-embed` is no longer ALIASED onto this
    # one.** It was, and correctly, while `google/siglip2-*` published a single
    # format both engines read — one list served both by construction, and
    # `_SHARED_SUGGESTIONS` carried the only cross-RUNNER alias in this file.
    # An ONNX export ends that coincidence: mlx-embeddings cannot open a `.onnx`
    # graph and `onnxruntime` cannot open MLX safetensors, so an alias would
    # offer every Mac a download its engine has no reader for. The two engines
    # still produce vectors in the SAME SPACE (`registry.py`'s comment on the
    # `mlx-embed` row), which is why a page can switch between them — the space
    # is shared, the files are not, and this file is keyed on the files.
    #
    # **`size_gb` here is the FETCHED file set, not the whole snapshot, and that
    # is a deliberate exception to this file's own convention.** Everywhere else
    # the figure is the Hub's per-file byte sum for the entire repo, because
    # that is what `download_snapshot` actually pulls — and the CLIP rejection
    # note below rests on exactly that reading. Every repo in this list breaks
    # the assumption behind it: they publish EIGHT quantizations of each tower
    # side by side, so the whole snapshot is 11.42 GB for the base export and
    # 29.5 GB for the so400m, none of which this app fetches.
    # `runners/onnx_embed.py`'s `download()` pins `allow_patterns` to the fp32
    # graphs plus the tokenizer, and the figures below are that set, in DECIMAL
    # GB (this file's own convention — see the LTX rows, which check out exactly
    # against `/1e9`), not GiB:
    #   nomic:   547,310,275 graph + 716,106 tokenizer/pooling config
    #            = 548,026,381 B = 0.55 GB
    #            (whole repo 2.2 GB — eight quantizations plus a safetensors copy)
    #   base:    372,975,112 vision + 1,129,469,657 text + 34,411,767 tokenizer
    #            + configs = 1,536,856,536 B = 1.54 GB
    #   so400m:  1,713,485,119 vision + 2,831,730,610 text (599,026 B of graph
    #            plus its 2,831,131,584 B external-data sidecar) + 34,412,213
    #            tokenizer/configs = 4,579,627,942 B = 4.58 GB
    # Measured against the Hub's own per-file byte sums, 2026-08-25 — and
    # `size_gb` below is each total rounded to one decimal (0.5/1.5/4.6), the
    # same rounding every other row in this file gets. An earlier version of
    # this comment carried a different set of component byte counts for base
    # and so400m, and neither the "1.54 GB"/"4.58 GB" it stated nor the
    # `size_gb` it shipped was that set's DECIMAL total — the decimal figure
    # those bytes actually produce is 1.61/4.80 GB, over the 0.05 tolerance
    # `test_ai_onnx_embed_real_weights.py` allows, which would have failed the
    # gate on a fully correct download and blamed `allow_patterns` for it. It
    # then called the 1.5/4.6 GB agreement with the torch repos' own figures "a
    # coincidence" — with the numbers corrected, it no longer needs that
    # excuse, but the underlying caution still holds: the ONNX export of a
    # tower is a different file from its safetensors, and a future re-export
    # can move either figure independently. `tests/test_ai_onnx_embed_real_weights.py`
    # asserts the on-disk total against these numbers on a machine that really
    # downloaded one, which is the only place the pin can be checked.
    #
    # **THE PROSE ROW LEADS THIS LIST, and that is the user-visible change on
    # this branch.** A bare `fused.ai.embed({texts})` used to load a 64-token
    # caption encoder; it now loads a 2048-token paragraph encoder. That is the
    # point of widening the capability — a SigLIP text tower truncates at 64
    # tokens, so no chunk size turns it into a document encoder, and RAG,
    # clustering and document search were all impossible at any setting. Anyone
    # who indexed a corpus with the old default has to re-index: the two models'
    # vectors are not comparable, and nothing can detect that they are not.
    #
    # Smallest first, per the module rule, which puts the ONE prose row at
    # position 0 — so it is what a bare `fused.ai.embed()` loads on any machine
    # that resolves to this engine. The two SigLIP2 exports sit below it: 768
    # dimensions is a comfortable vector to keep a few thousand of in a page, and
    # the so400m is the accuracy option at three times the disk and three times
    # the compute per item, with 1152-dim vectors that are a third more storage
    # for whoever is keeping them.
    #
    # **A CLIP export is deliberately absent**, and it is the entry a future
    # reader is most likely to try to add — CLIP is the famous one and it is
    # 512-dim. `onnx-community/clip-vit-base-patch32-ONNX` would even avoid the
    # reason the torch curation refused `openai/clip-vit-base-patch32` (that
    # repo ships TensorFlow, Flax and PyTorch-pickle copies beside the
    # safetensors, so the whole-repo pull is 3.6 GB for a weaker, English-only
    # encoder). What survives that change is the other half of the argument:
    # mlx-embeddings has no CLIP module, so a curated CLIP is an entry that
    # vanishes the moment a Mac switches engines. This runner still LOADS a
    # `clip` export a user fetches themselves (`formats.EMBED_MODEL_TYPES`);
    # this file is curation, and curating that download is a different question.
    #
    # Both repos are ungated and Apache-2.0, like their upstreams. **One line
    # each**, per the rule the transformers text list states.
    #
    # **Every row here has a KNOWN PROMPT SCHEME, and that is a curation rule
    # rather than a coincidence** (`formats.TEXT_EMBED_SCHEMES`, asserted by
    # `test_ai_catalog_embeddings.py`). A retrieval encoder instructs a question
    # and a passage differently, and a model whose convention this app does not
    # know embeds both verbatim — which still returns unit-length vectors of the
    # right dimension, just worse ones, with nothing downstream able to tell.
    # Recommending a model we cannot prompt correctly would be recommending a
    # silent accuracy loss.
    #
    # **`sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` is deliberately absent**, and
    # it is the entry a future reader is most likely to try to add: it is the
    # famous small one, its ONNX export is 90 MB, and it would take position 0
    # on size alone. It is not retrieval-trained — it was distilled on a
    # symmetric sentence-similarity objective, has no query/passage convention
    # to prompt with, and is measurably behind every row below on retrieval. Put
    # differently: the smallest-first rule would make it the DEFAULT, so adding
    # it would mean a bare embed call loading the one model here that is bad at
    # the job the capability exists for.
    #
    # **`BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5` is absent for the same structural reason, and
    # this one IS a deviation from the plan worth naming.** It is a good
    # retrieval encoder with a known scheme, and its fetched fp32 set is 0.44 GB
    # — SMALLER than the prose row below. Under the smallest-first rule that makes
    # it position 0 and therefore the default, and it is English-only at 512
    # tokens: a worse default than a 2048-token one for a capability whose whole
    # point is paragraphs, and a narrower one than the multilingual SigLIP2 the
    # default is moving away from. Curating it would mean either shipping that
    # default or adding the separate `default:` field this file's module
    # docstring explicitly rejects. It loads fine if a user fetches it
    # themselves, and its scheme is in `TEXT_EMBED_SCHEMES` for exactly that
    # case.
    #
    # **`intfloat/multilingual-e5-small` was curated here and was REMOVED — a
    # scope decision, not a defect.** It is a good encoder: 100 languages in one
    # space at 384-dim, 512 tokens, a known `e5` scheme, and a 0.49 GB fetch. It
    # loads fine when fetched by hand, and its scheme stays in
    # `TEXT_EMBED_SCHEMES` so that a user who does gets prompted correctly. What
    # went was the RECOMMENDATION: one curated prose encoder is the shortlist
    # this capability wants, and a second one that is smaller-but-shorter-context
    # is a comparison put in front of a reader who came to embed a paragraph.
    #
    # **It leaves one fact behind worth keeping, though it is no longer a
    # constraint.** e5-small is `model_type: bert` (a `BertModel` with an XLM-R
    # sentencepiece tokenizer — not `xlm-roberta`, which is the easy thing to
    # assume from its tokenizer files), and `bert` is in
    # `formats.MLX_EMBED_MODEL_TYPES` while nomic's `nomic_bert` is not. So while
    # e5 was curated here it was also the only curated prose model MLX could
    # open, and removing it briefly left the curated prose set ONNX-only.
    #
    # That is no longer the state: the `mlx-embed` block above curates
    # `mlx-community/nomicai-modernbert-embed-base-bf16`, a `modernbert`
    # conversion the gate admits, so each engine has its own curated prose row
    # from its own kind of repo. Nothing here needs to be re-added to close a
    # gap — and a row added back to THIS list would be an ONNX row, which is not
    # what a Mac reads.

#: Hardware variant -> the runner whose list it SHARES. Resolved by `for_runner`
#: rather than copied into `SUGGESTIONS`, and the direction of that choice is the
#: point.
#:
#: **This file is keyed by runner because a repo belongs to a BACKEND** — the
#: docstring's argument is about weights formats, `mlx-community/…` against
#: `Qwen/…`, and two lists exist because neither backend can open the other's
#: files. A CUDA build of Diffusers reads byte for byte what the CPU build
#: reads; the split between them is which wheel gets installed, and nothing
#: about which repos are loadable. So their lists must be identical BY
#: CONSTRUCTION. Three copied literals — one per Diffusers row — would be
#: identical only until somebody edited one of them, and the failure that
#: produces is silent on the page: a curated model offered on the CPU engine and
#: missing on the CUDA one, or worse, sized for a different budget. (Transformers
#: was this paragraph's example until D416 withdrew it; Diffusers is the
#: surviving three-row family and the argument is the same one.)
#:
#: An alias also keeps two invariants this file states elsewhere true: every id
#: still appears in exactly ONE list (`capability_of` reads that), and
#: `all_suggested_ids()` is not a pile of copies deduplicated by luck. Left
#: count-free deliberately: the number of literals aliasing avoids is the number
#: of rows in the table, which is a thing that changes.
#:
#: What must NOT be aliased is a runner that reads a different format. That is
#: the whole keying rule, and it is why this table names the specific pairs
#: instead of stripping a suffix off a code.

#: that. Both were curated for `transformers-embed`, which every platform could
#: run; with that engine gone their only curated home is `mlx-embed`, so a Linux
#: or Windows user who had already downloaded one is holding a snapshot no
#: engine available to them can read. The ONNX exports below are the same
#: checkpoints in the format the engine they DO have opens, which is what makes
#: the refusal a "fetch this instead" rather than a shrug.
#:
#: **Written out rather than derived, deliberately.** The mapping is
#: `google/X` -> `onnx-community/X-ONNX` for both rows, and that is a
#: coincidence of how one account names its conversions — not a rule. Inferring
#: it from string munging would invent ids for every other `google/*` repo on
#: the Hub and confidently recommend downloads that do not exist. Two lines of
#: data cannot do that.
#:
#: Not a migration to run, and nothing is rewritten on disk: the snapshot stays
#: exactly where it is, still perfectly loadable the moment the user opens the
#: same cache on a Mac. `counterpart_for` below is what checks that a
#: counterpart is REALLY curated for the engine being offered it, so this table
#: cannot outlive the rows it points at.
#: **The so400m pair was here and was REMOVED, because it stopped being a pair.**
#: The MLX so400m row is now `mlx-community/siglip2-so400m-patch16-384` and the

#: weights in another format. This table's entire claim is "the SAME model in the

#: counterpart of a patch16 conversion would break exactly the promise the
#: sentence makes. A stranded so400m snapshot now falls to `engine_gap`'s
#: no-counterpart branch, which names the engine that serves embeddings here and
#: recommends nothing — the honest answer.
#:
