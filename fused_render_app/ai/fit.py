"""Will this model FIT on this machine? — fused_render_app/ai/fit.py (SPEC AI-16,
AI-16b, AI-16c, AI-19, D497, D520, D521, D522, D541).

`ai_runtime._fit_verdict` used to be handed `size_gb` and asked a memory
question, which conflates two quantities that coincide only for a
single-checkpoint text model: `ltx-video` runs `DistilledPipeline
(low_memory=True)`, which FREES the transformer and the Gemma text encoder
between stages — its peak is one STAGE, its download (AI-11a) is every byte
of TWO repos — so a 28.5GB constant answered "Likely too big for this
machine" on a machine where it demonstrably renders. A cached, uncurated repo
was worse: its `size_gb` comes from bytes on DISK including every revision
the cache holds, a figure that drifts further from memory the longer the
cache lives.

**The verdict is computed here, not by the router, which is a view.** Over
the best FOOTPRINT available, on a precedence ladder that degrades to
today's behaviour rather than replacing it — a model nobody has run yet is
judged exactly as it was before this module existed:

    measured   footprints.py, keyed <capability>/<model_id> — this model has
               RUN here and this is what it cost
    declared   an optional `resident_gb` on a curated catalog entry — the
               curator (or the runner's own docstring) knows the envelope
    download   `size_gb` (or, since AI-19, a quantization-aware estimate
               built from `params` + a KV-cache term when the caller has
               them) — nothing MEASURED is known, so this rung is honest
               about being a guess

`None` when even `size_gb` is missing, unchanged: AI-11a's rule that an
unknown size is a dash and never a guess governs the verdict too.
`resident_gb` is optional and additive, the shape AI-11i/AI-11j already
established for `recommended`/`acceptsImage` — a curator MAY answer, and
absence falls through rather than meaning anything.

`verdict()` returns `{verdict, basis, footprintBytes, score, runMode}` or
`None` — never a bare string, so the page can word a MEASURED verdict as a
fact rather than a guess (AI-16c) instead of hedging every answer the same
way, and can render a continuous bar (AI-19) instead of only a three-way
badge.

**AI-19's one coherent change to this module** (SPEC items 3-7 of the fit/
categorization/download overhaul): a flat runtime-overhead constant, a
quantization-aware weight-size table, a KV-cache term, VRAM-vs-RAM pool
selection with a run-mode concept, and a continuous Gaussian fit score that
replaces the old `EASY_FRACTION` cliff. All four land ONLY on the `download`
rung's arithmetic — `measured` and `declared` are already real, observed
numbers (a resident-set sample, a curator's own envelope), and adding a
flat overhead or a computed KV term on TOP of an observation that already
includes whatever overhead and cache the model actually used would double
count it. The `download` rung is the one place this module has ever had to
GUESS, and it is the one AI-19 makes a better guess.

    **Two qualifiers need an explicit decision, not a regex that happens to
    fire on them:**

    `"8B (~1B active)"` (SPEC-MoE rows — `LiquidAI/LFM2.5-8B-A1B-*`) states
    BOTH a total parameter count and an active-per-token count. Those two
    numbers mean genuinely different things for memory: an MoE checkpoint's
    inactive experts are ordinary tensors on disk and in memory (the
    catalog's own note on that row: "MoE experts are ordinary tensors...
    the whole [checkpoint] is fetched and resident, and the win is
    arithmetic per token, not bytes") — only COMPUTE and memory BANDWIDTH
    scale with the active count, not resident weight bytes. A
    footprint estimate is a memory question, so this parses the LEADING
    (total) figure and drops the parenthetical deliberately — `_PARAMS_
    VALUE_PATTERN.search` already returns the first match in the string,
    which is the total by construction of how every MoE row here is
    written (`"<total>B (~<active>B active)"`), so no special-casing is
    needed to get the right one; this paragraph exists so that "which
    number, and why" is written down rather than left as an accident of
    regex ordering.

    `"4B effective"` (`gemma-4-e4b-it-*` — Gemma's own "E4B" naming, a
    MatFormer/nested-submodel scheme) is the OPPOSITE situation: the string
    gives exactly one number, and that number is a compute-quality-parity
    figure, not a parameter count — the checkpoint's real resident size is
    measurably larger than a literal 4B (checked against this build's own
    catalog rows: `gemma-4-e4b-it-4bit`'s curated `size_gb` is 5.2 at MLX
    4-bit, `4e9 x 0.55 GB_BYTES = 2.2e9` bytes — under HALF the curated
    figure, while treating the row as an ~8B checkpoint lands within
    single-digit percent, see the verification below). Unlike the MoE form,
    there is no second number in the string to fall back to — parsing "4B
    effective" as a literal 4B would be exactly the wrong figure for a
    resident-weight estimate, so this returns `None` for ANY string
    containing "effective" rather than silently taking the one number that
    happens to be there, and `_weight_bytes` falls back to the curated

    `footprint_store` — from `footprints.load_store()` — lets a caller
    answering MANY entries in one request (SPEC AI-16, code review) skip a

    Every keyword from `quantization` on is optional and additive, the same

    of how much else is known. `params` accepts `catalog.py`'s free-text
    display string directly (`"1.2B"`, `"8B (~1B active)"`) — `parse_params`
    is what turns it into a raw count, or answers `None` and falls back to
    `size_gb` when it cannot (see that function's own docstring for the
    two qualifier forms that need a deliberate decision, not a lucky
    regex). `num_hidden_layers` through `kv_dtype` feed the KV-cache term
    (SPEC item 5) — see `_kv_cache_bytes` for what each one means and what
    it falls back to. `num_hidden_layers` through `layer_types` are the same
    field NAMES `hub_metadata.get()` returns (minus its `numHiddenLayers`-
    style camelCase), so `ai_runtime._kv_geometry_kwargs` passes that dict
    through with a straight `**`-unpack; `kv_dtype` has no `hub_metadata`
    counterpart, so that same caller supplies it itself, from the runner the
    catalog row will actually load through rather than from anything

    the selected pool at all) is "no". `score` itself (0-100) is exposed

    only a badge.

    VRAM+RAM offload budget, or plain system RAM) `_select_pool` judged the

    it always has, and `runMode` reads `"gpu"` since Metal is unified-memory
    accelerated compute, not a separate carveout to distinguish from RAM.

    matter how much of the reserve is unused. **Checked first, and entirely
    independent of `_select_pool`** — the ceiling is a real, machine-read
    number and stays load-bearing exactly as SPEC AI-19's own instructions
    require, whichever pool the rest of this function would have selected.

    A MEASURED "no" is reachable and is not a contradiction: the footprint
    store only ever holds models that ran, but the budget here is what is
    left after the reserve, so a model measured above it ran while nothing
    else was competing for memory. `basis` is what lets a reader (AI-16c)
    tell that apart from a guess.

    `_select_pool` used to call `hw_detect.cached_hardware()` itself,
    which is a `storage.read_json` open plus a JSON parse EVERY time this
    function runs, and a catalog request answers dozens of entries through
    this same function on a route the model picker polls — the exact cost
    `machine_ram_gb` is `lru_cache`d to avoid, just not paid off here yet.
    Unlike `machine_ram_gb`, a PERMANENT cache is the wrong fix: `hw_detect
    .start_hardware_refresh()` rewrites `ai_hardware.json` on a 6-hour tick
    (an eGPU plugged in mid-session, say), and a `functools.lru_cache`d
    reading would never see that — the exact staleness the background
    refresh exists to prevent. So this is a PER-REQUEST reading threaded
    through, `footprint_store`'s own shape: left unpassed (the default),
    this calls `hw_detect.cached_hardware()` itself — correct for a
    one-off lookup, and what every test and single-verdict caller still
    gets, and still the ONLY `hw_detect` call this module makes (the
    boundary `tests/test_ai_hw_detect.py::
    test_fit_module_only_reads_the_cache_never_the_probe` pins) — passed
    explicitly, a caller answering MANY entries in one request reads the
    cache once and threads the SAME reading through every `verdict()` call,
    each one at most as fresh as that one read, exactly like
    `footprint_store`.

    """The largest footprint this machine could plausibly hold, in bytes —
    the ONE reusable memory-budget notion this module already computes
    (`RESERVE_BYTES`, the Apple wired-limit ceiling, VRAM-vs-RAM pool
    selection via `_select_pool`), exposed for a caller that needs a
    budget BEFORE it has a specific footprint to judge — a GGUF file
    picker (`formats.select_gguf_recipe`) deciding WHICH file to fetch in
    the first place, not `verdict()`'s own job of judging one footprint
    already chosen.

    **Reusing this rather than a second computation is the point.** Two
    independent "how much memory do I have" answers that could disagree —
    this function computing one figure, `verdict()` computing a different
    one for the SAME machine — would be strictly worse than the single
    hard-coded recipe table item 14 replaces: a picker that fetches by ONE
    budget and a fit badge that judges by ANOTHER would show a model as
    both "the one we picked for your machine" and "tight"/"no" in the
    same breath. So this shares every input `verdict()` does: the wired-
    limit ceiling on Apple Silicon (checked first, exactly like `verdict()`
    — MLX cannot allocate past it regardless of the pool arithmetic below),
    and `_select_pool` off Apple.

    **The COMBINED VRAM+RAM offload ceiling, not VRAM alone, on a discrete
    GPU.** `_select_pool` normally picks between the two by comparing a
    SPECIFIC footprint against VRAM — but a budget computed before any
    footprint exists has nothing to compare, so this asks for the ceiling
    `_select_pool` would report for a footprint too large to fit VRAM by
    itself (`math.inf`), which is exactly its COMBINED-pool branch: the
    true maximum this machine could ever hold via `llama_text._offload_
    schedule`'s existing CPU-offload backoff. A caller that then picks a
    file BELOW even the VRAM-alone figure loses nothing — `_select_pool`'s
    branches only change how much of that pool is GPU-resident, not
    whether the bytes fit somewhere on the machine at all, which is the
    only question a pre-footprint budget can honestly answer.

    `hardware` mirrors `verdict()`'s own keyword exactly: a caller
    answering many entries in one request threads ONE `hw_detect.cached_
    hardware()` reading through every call; a lone caller (the default)
    reads the cache itself, the same `_NOT_GIVEN` sentinel shape `verdict()`
    already uses.

    `None` when RAM itself cannot be read — the same "nothing to judge
    against" answer `verdict()` gives for the identical reason.
