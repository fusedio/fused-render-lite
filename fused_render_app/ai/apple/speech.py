"""`afm-speech`: one transcription through the Apple helper, run as a job.

The route (`routers/ai_runtime.py::api_ai_transcribe`) validates, decides the
output paths and opens the row; this module does the run on a thread and
writes EXACTLY the files the Whisper workers write — the same `.json` keys,
the same `.txt`, the same `.partial.jsonl` through `runners/partial.py` —
because `runtime.js`'s `done()` and `templates/shared/fused_ai.py` read those
files, not this module's reply. A page must not be able to tell which engine
ran (AI-10c).

Borrowed from the supervisor rather than reimplemented: the row payload
(`transcribe_row_fields`), the reporter (`_report`), the ✕ (`_cancel_
requested`), and the error wording (`_failure_text`). Not borrowed: the
worker table — see `host.py`'s docstring for why this tier is not a Runner.
