"""Resident model processes: start, evict, measure, stop (SPEC §40).

One table, one lock, one worker per capability. Everything a model does happens
in a subprocess this module owns:

    load(model, capability) -> a job id
        build the runner's venv if needed (envinstall, PY-18)
        -> start worker.py on that venv's python
        -> worker downloads what it lacks and loads it
        -> worker binds an ephemeral port and publishes {port, token}
        -> supervisor polls /health until ready

**One resident model per capability, auto-evicting.** Loading a second text model
unloads the first before the new one starts. This is not a policy choice so much
as arithmetic: an 8GB model and another 8GB model on a 16GB machine is a swap
storm, and a swap storm reads to the user as "the app hung". A text model and an
image model coexist because they are different capabilities and the user asked
for both.

**Load is asynchronous and reported, never awaited on the request path.** A cold
load is a multi-GB download followed by a minutes-long weight load. `load()`
returns a JOB ID immediately and the work continues on a thread; progress goes to
the download manager (`jobs.py`, SPEC §36) under the deterministic id
`sys:ai-model:<repo>`, so the AI Models page can join a job row onto a repo card
and the manager's ✕ can stop it. The `sys:` prefix marks it server-owned: the ✕
really kills the process here, rather than asking a page to stop politely.

**The worker is trusted to describe itself.** Its `/health` reports resident
bytes, because only the process holding the weights can measure them — and on
Apple Silicon "GPU memory" is the same unified pool as RSS, so there is one
honest number rather than two. What the supervisor knows independently is
whether the process is ALIVE; a worker that stops answering is `error`, never a
`ready` row that lies.

Nothing here imports torch, mlx, or huggingface_hub. This module speaks HTTP to a
process and reads a status file; the heavy imports live on the other side of that
boundary, in an interpreter this one built.

    **On macOS, workers are started with `posix_spawn`, never `fork()`.**
    CPython picks `posix_spawn` only for a narrow Popen shape (3.12
    `subprocess._execute_child`: no `cwd`, `close_fds=False`, no
    `start_new_session`, no `preexec_fn`, every redirected fd above 2), and
    falls back to `fork()` + `exec()` the moment any of those is set. The old
    shape here set three of them, so every worker was forked — and a forked
    child runs the parent's `pthread_atfork` child handlers before it ever
    reaches `exec()`.

    That is what killed the embeddings worker on a fresh machine, with
    `the worker exited before it started (code -11)` and an EMPTY stderr:
    the crash report shows the child dying in `do_fork_exec → fork →
    _pthread_atfork_child_handlers → osgeo::proj::io::SQLiteHandleCache →
    sqlite3Close → sqlite3_log → os_log_type_enabled → SIGSEGV`. PROJ (loaded
    into THIS server process through pyproj/shapely the moment any geo page
    renders) registers an atfork handler that closes its SQLite handles in
    the child, SQLite logs while doing so, and `os_log` after `fork()` is the
    documented macOS hazard. Nothing about the worker, its venv or MLX was at
    fault — the same worker started fine from a shell, and the same server
    could not start ANY worker once PROJ was resident. Reproduced exactly with
    a deliberately crashing atfork handler: the fork shape dies -11 every
    time, the `posix_spawn` shape never does.

    `posix_spawn` runs no atfork handlers, so the worker gets its own process
    with none of the parent's native state in the way. The two things the old
    shape did for the child — `cwd` and a fresh session/process group for
    `_kill_tree`'s `killpg` — the worker now does for itself, first thing in
    `worker_base.serve`: `chdir` to `WORKER_CWD_ENV` and `os.setsid()`.

    filename would be refused by the client and the mirror would be off for every

    The decision has to happen HERE, in the server process, because `catalog` is
    unreachable from a runner's interpreter — a worker imports `worker_base` and
    `mirror` as bare modules with no `fused_render_app` package on `sys.path`. But
    the reason it must happen here is a privacy one rather than a mechanical
    one: the worker is told the answer for the ONE model it was sent to fetch

    The PYTHON* vars are stripped for the reason `local_chat/chat.py` documents

    inside itself, and a venv interpreter that inherits it dies at startup with
    "Failed to import encodings module" before running a line. The origin is
    passed through so the worker can report its own download progress.

    **No Hub token is placed here, deliberately** (D402). A worker imports
    `huggingface_hub` and therefore finds the machine's token exactly where every
    other hf caller finds it — hf's own store, written by the Preferences login
    button (routers/hf_auth.py) — or an `HF_TOKEN` this process already inherited
    and passes on in the copy below. Nothing in this app holds a credential to
    inject, and manufacturing one here would assert something about an
    environment the caller was asked nothing about.

    **`FUSED_MODEL_MIRROR_OK` is the model mirror's permission** and carries the
    repo id the worker will NAME to the mirror rather than a bare flag, so a
    value that arrived some other way cannot licence a probe for whatever the
    next download happens to be. That id is not always what this app calls the
    model — a curated GGUF is a filename here and a repo id there (AI-5m) — and
    `_mirror_ok` is what translates it. It is
    also POPPED when the answer is no, because this environment is a copy of the
    server's: an operator (or a parent process) exporting it would otherwise hand
    every worker permission for every model. `FUSED_MODEL_MIRROR` itself is left
    alone — an operator pointing it at staging is the supported way to use this,
    and unset now means the shipped default (`mirror.DEFAULT_BASE`), not "no
    mirror" — this permission is what still keeps that default from widening
    anything: a base URL alone names no repo, and only a suggested model's id
    ever reaches `FUSED_MODEL_MIRROR_OK`.

    **`FUSED_AI_MEMORY_BUDGET_BYTES` carries `fit.available_budget_bytes()`
    across the identical process boundary** (SPEC AI-24 item 14's real
    wiring) — a worker's bare-module interpreter cannot import
    `fused_render_app.ai.fit`/`hw_detect` (see `formats.py`'s own top-of-file
    note on why it stays stdlib-only), so the one place this figure CAN be
    computed is here, server-side, on every spawn — never once and cached,
    since `hw_detect`'s own background refresh means the answer can
    genuinely change between one worker's bring-up and the next. `llama_
    text.py`'s curated-recipe resolver is the one reader today. POPPED when
    the computation answers `None` (RAM itself unreadable), for the same
    "this environment is a copy of the server's" reason `FUSED_MODEL_
    MIRROR_OK` is: a stale or operator-set value must not silently outlive

    """Everything a report must carry for a transcription row to survive being
    RE-CREATED — the row's identity, as opposed to its progress.

    **Any row can be rebuilt from scratch at any tick.** `jobs._sweep` drops the
    least recently updated running row once `MAX_JOBS` (64) bites, and a queue
    of transcriptions is precisely what produces more than 64 rows — so a
    reporter whose tick omits a field does not update a row missing it, it
    creates one where that field is `Job`'s DEFAULT. `title` is the extreme
    case (without it `upsert` raises and the row never comes back at all), but
    it is only the loudest: `cancellable` defaults to False, which hides the ✕
    on a row the manager then draws with a DISMISS cross instead — operable
    looking and inert; `unit` defaults to "" and reverts the seconds clock to a
    bare pair of numbers; and `state` is what lets a `_forget`-ten row reopen
    at all, since a tick that does not say `running` is answered as a late tick
    from work the user already closed.

    So this is a PAYLOAD rather than a list of fields to remember, and it is
    passed to the worker in the request body rather than re-spelled there —
    every reporter on a transcription's lifecycle (this module's opening
    report, its queue ticks, its terminal report, and all four of the worker's)
    restates the same thing, and none of them can drift from it.

    `state` is deliberately NOT here: the terminal report needs `done`/`error`/
    `cancelled` and would have to override it. Callers say their own.

    `model` rides along the same way, for the same reason: a dimmed suffix on
    the title row (jobs.py `Job.model`) that a rebuilt row must not lose any
    more than it may lose its title.

    `page` rides along for the identical reason — the destination a click on
    this row should go to (the page that started the transcription, over
    `X-Fused-Page`) is exactly as much this row's identity as its title is,
    and a rebuilt row that dropped it would send the next click nowhere.

    `origin` is `jobs.origin_for_page(page)` — no literal, and no shared
    default either. Unlike `text_row_fields`, this payload is shared by more
    than one caller with genuinely different origins: the Playground's
    transcribe stage AND `apps/claude/ann/transcribe.ts`'s annotation
    transcription both build a request through this same row shape
    (`start_transcribe`, `apple/speech.py`'s `start`), so a single hardcoded
    label would be right for one and wrong for the other. The annotation
    caller runs inside a page and has a real `page` to derive from; the
    Playground's transcribe stage runs in the shell like every other
    Playground stage and sends none — `test_the_worker_is_given_the_row_
    identity_to_restate` pins exactly that case (`"page": "", "origin": ""`).
    With no default to fall back on for that caller, `origin` is left out of
    this dict ENTIRELY when there is nothing real to derive, rather than
    written as `""` — a worker's restate tick (this dict spread straight
    into its `report` body) is a `"origin" in body and server` write in
    `jobs.upsert`, so a present-but-empty key would blank an origin an
    earlier report on the same row already set, every single tick.

    holding it).

    Driven from `server/ai.py`'s `_local_relay`, not from this module: that
    is the caller that already turns a done-frame/error/cancellation into a
    verdict for both the streaming and non-streaming shapes, and it is the
    one that mints ids for the other kinds too (`image_job_id`,
    `transcribe_job_id`). `generate_text` itself stays fail-fast with no job
    of its own — see its own docstring — so there is nothing here shaped
    like `_transcribe_row`'s in-progress variant; the caller builds its own
    opening/tick/terminal payloads directly off this one.

    `unit="tokens"`: the row counts chunks emitted, not bytes or seconds —
    unlike a transcription's `"s"` or a download's `"bytes"`, the useful
    number here is how much has been said so far.

    `page` is the destination a click on this row should go to — the page
    that made the `/api/ai` request, over `X-Fused-Page` — restated here for
    the same reason `transcribe_row_fields` restates it: this dict is the
    row's identity, resent on every tick, and a tick that dropped it would
    leave a rebuilt row with nowhere to send a click.

    `tier=jobs.TRANSIENT`: the Playground's text stage keeps no history and
    persists nothing (`TextStage.tsx` sends `history: []`), so a finished
    generation has no destination a click could open and nothing a
    Notification would be keeping around — `_sweep` ages a `done` transient
    row like this one out on the read-gated clock rather than waiting on a
    dismiss. A failed one is different on both counts: `effective_tier`'s
    override turns it `attention` for VISIBILITY, and `_sweep` only ages a
    transient row out once its state is `done` — an error/cancelled
    generation is kept until dismissed, same as any other row a surface can
    show and let the user clear.

    `origin` is derived from `page` (`jobs.origin_for_page`), not a bare
    "Playground" literal: `server/ai.py`'s `_local_relay` is the generic
    local-model path for `POST /api/ai`, reachable from any page that calls
    `fused.ai("…")`, so a hardcoded label would caption a user app's own
    generation as though the shipped Playground had raised it.
    `default="Playground"` covers the one caller that has no page to name —
    the AI Models Playground runs in the shell, not a page iframe, and sends
    no `X-Fused-Page` of its own — so an empty `page` here still reads

    docstring) so the two can never quietly diverge on what "idle" means.

    **Only `state == "ready"` is eligible.** A `starting` / `venv` /
    `downloading` / `loading` worker is not holding a finished model yet — a

    interval, then the thread sleeps and re-sweeps forever. `ai_runtime.py`
    now calls `hub_metadata.cached()` only, which is a plain disk read and
    never touches the network — this thread is the only writer.

                row: dict | None = None) -> Worker:
    """Make `model` resident, reporting the wait to `job`. Blocking.

    `row` is the caller's row IDENTITY, restated on every tick of the wait —
    see `transcribe_row_fields`. Optional because the image path does not yet
    supply one, and its ticks behave exactly as before without it; but a wait
    for a COLD model is the longest-running reporter in this module (a
    multi-GB pull), so it is the likeliest of all of them to be the tick that
    has to re-create an evicted row rather than update it. Without an identity
    it cannot: `upsert` refuses a first report with no title, `_report`
    swallows that, and the row stays gone for the whole download — no
    progress, no ✕, and a page told the transcription failed.

    Text generation cannot do this — a chat box must not hang for the minutes a
    cold load takes, so `generate_text` fails fast with the job id instead. An
    image CAN: the caller already has a job to watch, because rendering a
    picture is minutes of work whether or not the weights were already in
    memory. So the wait is part of the job rather than a second failure the
    caller has to orchestrate around.

    **The rows are MERGED while the wait lasts, not doubled.** The load still
    reports to its OWN row (`sys:ai-model:<repo>`, with the download's byte
    counts) — the AI Models page joins repo cards onto exactly that id, so it
    still has to exist and still has to be truthful even when nobody is
    waiting on it. But two rows both saying "waiting for FLUX to load" is the
    same fact told twice under different titles (SPEC §36 — one row per unit
    of work), so for as long as this wait holds, the CALLER's row mirrors the
    load row's own `detail`/`done`/`total`/`unit`/`total_scope` verbatim and
    sets `waiting_for` to the load's job id — a client-side filter
    (`jobs.ts` `mergedRows`) then hides the load row while `waiting_for`
    names it and it is still running, so the manager draws one row instead of
    two. The load row is never deleted or hidden on the SERVER: hiding it here
    instead would break that join.

    Deliberate non-goal: cancelling the MERGED row does not cancel the shared
    load. A render's ✕ stopping THIS wait must not stop a load another
    waiter (or the AI Models page's own download) may depend on — cancelling
    the merged row only ends this waiter, and the load's row simply
    reappears, with its own ✕, once nothing else is `waiting_for` it.

    The merge is cleared on EVERY exit from the wait — ready, error, evicted,
    cancelled, or timed out (the `finally` below) — because if the LOAD then
    fails, the load row must not still be hidden: D266's promise that both
    rows can show a real failure only holds for as long as the merge does not
    outlive the wait it describes. Two rows for two failures is right; two
    rows for one wait is not. The clearing tick restores the caller's own
    `unit` (`(row or {}).get("unit", "")` — the image/video opening report
    uses `unit=""`, a queued transcription's `transcribe_row_fields` pins
    `"s"`) and clears `done`/`total`, but deliberately leaves `detail` alone:
    a flash of blank detail between this tick and the caller's next one is
    worse than one stale line for a moment.

    Both rows have to be able to say the same failure regardless of the merge,
    which is what `_start_resident` returning the record is for (D266).
