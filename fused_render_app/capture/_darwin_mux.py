"""macOS 13–14 screen recording: the muxer that `SCRecordingOutput` would be.

**Why this module exists.** `SCRecordingOutput` — the API that writes the .mov
for `_darwin.py` without a single sample buffer passing through Python — is
macOS 15. Below it `SCStream` still delivers frames and system audio (12.3 and
13.0 respectively), so what is missing is not the capture but the WRITER. This
module supplies one: an `AVAssetWriter` with a video input and an audio input,
fed from an `SCStreamOutput` delegate.

**What that costs, stated plainly, because it reverses the property D409 was
proud of.** Sample buffers DO pass through Python here — one callback per video
frame and per audio packet. They are not touched: the delegate checks a status
attachment and calls `appendSampleBuffer_`, so no pixels are read and the CPU
cost is a bridge crossing, not an encode. The exception is `audio: "both"`,
which reads and rewrites the audio bytes (`_mixdown`), because two sources have
to become one track and below 15 nothing else will do it.

The real risk is not throughput but LATENCY: every callback needs the GIL, and
`SCStream` drops buffers whose handler is slow. User Python and AI inference
both run out of process (`_child.py`, `ai/supervisor.py`), so the in-process
competition is uvicorn's I/O and the index scanner's `os.walk` bursts. Against
that: `queueDepth` is raised to its maximum, and every drop is COUNTED and
surfaced rather than lost quietly — `dropped_frames` on the handle is what a
reader should look at before believing a recording is fine.

**Three audio modes are three different data paths**, and only one of them is
hard:

  * `"system"` — ScreenCaptureKit's audio buffers go straight to the writer.
  * `"mic"` — an `AVCaptureSession` + `AVCaptureAudioDataOutput` delivers
    `CMSampleBuffer`s that go straight to the writer too, with no byte surgery.
    The FORMAT is still requested rather than taken as it comes (`_start_mic`),
    because most built-in microphones are mono and the writer's input is
    stereo. `device` selection works here exactly as `microphoneCaptureDeviceID`
    works on 15.
  * `"both"` — the only path that mixes, and the only one that forces a format
    (48 kHz float32 on both sides) so that mixing is an elementwise add. See
    `_mixdown` for the ring and the drift it corrects.

**`AVCaptureAudioDataOutput`, never `AVCaptureAudioFileOutput`.** D409 records
in detail how the FILE output hung every `stop()` forever: `stopRecording`
marshals with `performSelector:onThread:waitUntilDone:YES` and this app has no
run loop on the thread it wants. A DATA output has no such call — it delivers to
a dispatch queue and is stopped with `AVCaptureSession.stopRunning`, which
blocks briefly but marshals nowhere. That is the reason the microphone can come
back here at all.

**No new dependency for the dispatch queues.** `SCStream` and
`AVCaptureAudioDataOutput` both want a serial `dispatch_queue_t` and pyobjc's
libdispatch bindings are not installed (and would be a core dep for two calls).
`dispatch_queue_create` through ctypes on libSystem returns a pointer that
`objc.objc_object` wraps into an `OS_dispatch_queue_serial`, which is what both
selectors take — ctypes for one platform call, no new dependency. The queues
are created ONCE at module scope and never released:
the ownership semantics of a ctypes-made object behind a pyobjc proxy are not
worth discovering per recording.
