"""macOS capture: ScreenCaptureKit for pixels, AVFoundation for the microphone.

**Nothing shells out and no frames pass through Python.** `SCRecordingOutput`
(macOS 15+) writes the .mov itself and `AVAudioRecorder` writes the .m4a, so this module starts a stream, stops a stream, and never touches a
sample buffer — which is the reason it can be this short, and the reason a
90-minute recording costs no Python at all while it runs. It is also the rule
AI-10 states about `ffmpeg` applied to `/usr/bin/screencapture`: the binary is
not ours, and it cannot capture system audio anyway.

**Everything Apple is confined here.** `capture/__init__.py` owns ids, paths,
job rows and the registry; this module answers `probe`, `start_screen`,
`start_audio` and `screenshot`, and returns opaque handles the neutral half only
ever hands back to `stop`.

**No run loop, anywhere, and that constraint chose one of the two APIs here.**
`start` and `stop` are two HTTP requests, so they arrive on two different uvicorn
worker threads, and neither the packaged app nor a source install can promise a
run loop on whatever thread AVFoundation would like to talk to. ScreenCaptureKit
is fine with that — dispatch queues throughout. `AVCaptureAudioFileOutput` was
not, and hung forever; `AVAudioRecorder` is (see `start_audio`, which records
what that cost).

Every async API is bridged to a `threading.Event` with a timeout: a capture that
never starts must raise, not hang a request forever.
