"""Native screen, microphone and still capture — the `fused.capture` bridge.

**Platform-neutral half.** This module owns everything that is not per-OS: ids,
output paths, the session registry, the job row a recording appears as in the
download manager, and the watchdog thread that ticks it. A backend owns the
frames and the file, and is asked for a short list — `probe`, `start_screen`,
`start_audio`, `stop`, `screenshot`, plus the optional `refuse` and `failure` —
so a backend is a module, not a second design.

**One backend, and it is native.** The Render App runs on macOS only, and
`_darwin.py` records with ScreenCaptureKit and AVFoundation (`_darwin_mux.py`
and `_mixdown.py` carry the mic+system audio mix). Native is the right choice
here rather than a convenience: on macOS the browser cannot capture system audio
at all, so a page's own `MediaRecorder` could never produce the recording this
module writes. Any other `sys.platform` is answered with `Unsupported`.

**What the design buys.** The output is a FILE whose path is known before the
first frame exists, so `fused.ai.transcribe({path})` is the next line rather
than a blob round-trip through JS; and a recording is a job row, so the
download manager can show and stop it.

**"Unavailable" always carries a REASON.** Wrong OS, an OS too old
(`SCRecordingOutput` is macOS 15+, `SCScreenshotManager` 14+, against
`LSMinimumSystemVersion` 11.0), a missing permission. `sources()` answers all
of it without ever showing a prompt —
the prompt belongs to the first real capture, not to a page asking what is
possible (the same rule the GPU probe follows, SPEC §40).

    here, the "never die" is there.

    **The cap is checked first, before anything that can fail**, and that
    ordering is the guarantee rather than a preference. `DEFAULT_MAX_SECONDS`
    exists so that a recording nobody stops still ends — a hard promise about
    turning a microphone off — while the two probes under it are signals about
    a recording that is still running. A probe that fails on every tick (a
    backend hook raising, an unreadable job store) would, placed above the cap,
    strand the recording for as long as the process lives; `_watch`'s guard
    would log each failure and change nothing. Below it, the same failure costs
    a message.

    The cost of the order is two ties, both inside one tick and both falling
    the safe way. A recording that DIES in the tick it reaches its cap ends as
    "done" rather than "error" — the file was written up to the cap either way,
    so the row is the only difference. A ✕ pressed in that same tick is missed
    and the file is KEPT rather than discarded, which is the direction to miss
    in: the user can delete a recording they have, and cannot recover one this
    threw away.
