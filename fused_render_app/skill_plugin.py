"""Assemble the canonical fused-render skills into a Claude Code **plugin root**
that fused-render owns outright, under ``home_dir()/skill-plugin/`` (D216).

Why a plugin root and not just skills written into the user's own Claude
config (D185, since replaced by ``user_plugin.py`` — D492): that sync is a *guess* about the machine, and every way it can miss is
silent. The dir it writes to may not be the one the CLI reads
(``CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`` set after we resolved it), a same-named user-authored
skill correctly makes us skip (marker ownership), the user may delete a skill
mid-session, and on a fresh install nothing guarantees the sync ran before the
first session did. In each case the session starts *without* the skill and
nothing says so — the model simply doesn't know the bridge contract and writes
an app against APIs that don't exist.

A directory plugin removes the guess. The sessions fused-render launches are
spawned by us, so we can hand the CLI the skills explicitly:
``claude --plugin-dir <root>`` loads them for that session only, from a path we
just wrote, regardless of the state of the user's ``~/.claude``. The plugin
loader wants a fixed shape::

    <root>/.claude-plugin/plugin.json     the manifest (plugin name, metadata)
    <root>/skills/<name>/SKILL.md         one dir per skill

and that shape is what this module builds. The repo root already *is* such a
root (committed ``.claude-plugin/plugin.json`` beside the committed ``skills/``,
which is what makes `claude plugin marketplace add fusedio/fused-render` work)
— but the end user almost never has the repo, so the same tree has to be
reassembled from whatever the install actually shipped.

Which skills go in, and where each comes from, is ``skill_sources.py``'s
answer (D490) — a scan of ``skills/`` rather than a list this module has to keep
in step with the other deliveries. It keeps D106's single-source rule, and the
manifest below follows the same order: the repo-level ``skills/`` +
``.claude-plugin/plugin.json`` win when resolvable (editable/dev installs —
always the current truth), else the packaged copies under
``fused_render/skills/`` that ``scripts/hatch_build.py`` writes at build time.
The packaged manifest deliberately sits at
``fused_render/skills/plugin.json`` — NOT in a packaged ``.claude-plugin/``
dir — so nothing in the wheel lives under a dot-prefixed path; the dotted dir
exists only in the assembled output, where we mkdir it ourselves. (A dotted
directory in a wheel is a packaging tripwire: it depends on how the build
backend's include globs treat hidden paths, and getting it wrong drops the file
from the wheel with no error at all — a field-only failure.)

The whole module is best-effort and never raises: callers are server startup and
scaffolding, and a chat that loads without the skill is still a working chat.

#
# A canvas clone's CLAUDE.md points the session at the canvas.toml format
# reference and friends. Those skills are the `workbench` plugin — published in
# the PUBLIC `fusedio/skills` repo, not shipped in this wheel — and the app hands

# from a scan of Claude Code's own plugin storage
# (`~/.claude/plugins/{marketplaces,cache}/<market>/workbench`), and that is gone
# for two reasons. First, the layout is Claude Code's private business and the
# only signal a scan has is the directory shape — so it cannot tell an installed
# plugin from an UNINSTALLED one: the uninstall leaves the cache dir behind,
# tombstoned with an `.orphaned_at` marker the scan knew nothing about, and the
# plugin the user removed came back. Second, discovery made the root a fact about
# the MACHINE, which invited handing it to every session; these skills belong to
# canvas clones alone (the gate lives in `templates/claude/agent.py:_plugin_argv`,
# which is where the target path is known). A clone we fetch is the opposite on
# both counts: its presence means we put it there, and its lifetime is ours.
#
# Rejected: `claude plugin install` (or a marketplace add). It would work, and it
# would load the workbench skills into EVERY `claude` on the machine — including
# the user's own unrelated sessions — which is precisely the leak the gate exists
# to prevent, and a mutation of their config we have no consent for.
#
# `--plugin-dir` is repeatable, which is what makes composing the two roots

# -- retiring the LEGACY `fused` plugin ---------------------------------------
#
# Before the rename (D360) the canvas skills shipped as a `fused` plugin the user
# was told to install themselves, via a `fused claude plugin add` printed in the
# seeded CLAUDE.md of the day. That instruction is long gone and the app now hands
# the skills to a canvas session itself — but an install the user performed then
# is still installed NOW, globally, and its skills are stale copies of the ones
# under a live `workbench:` prefix.
#
# Stale skills are the worst failure shape available here, because they do not
# look like one: they load cleanly and teach a canvas.toml format that no longer
# exists. Worse, the old CLAUDE.md named the `fused:` prefix, so a clone seeded
# back then points its session straight at them. Disabling is therefore not
# tidying — it is the removal of a wrong answer that outranks the right one.
#
# This DOES mutate the user's global Claude config, which D360 refused to do for
# the install side and the refusal still stands there: adding skills to every
# session on the machine is a leak, and `--plugin-dir` exists so we never have
# to. Retiring a plugin the app itself told the user to install is the opposite
# transaction — we are taking back our own footprint, not planting a new one —
# and it is done in the narrowest, most reversible form there is:
#
#   * ONLY `fused@fused-marketplace`, matched exactly. Never a prefix or
#     marketplace-wide sweep: `agent-core@fused-marketplace` and friends are
#     live plugins from the same marketplace and none of our business.
#   * Only when the key is ALREADY present and truthy. A machine that never had
#     it keeps a settings.json we never touched — writing `false` for an absent
#     plugin would state on disk that something is installed-and-off when
#     nothing is installed at all.
#   * Flipped to `false`, never deleted. `false` is exactly what the
#     Preferences page's own toggle writes, so the plugin stays listed there and
#     one click puts it back; a delete would make it vanish with no trace of
#     what happened or how to undo it.
#
# Serialized through `claude_config.lib.config_lock()` — the same thread lock +
# flock pair the Preferences page takes — because that page can be rewriting
# settings.json from another request (or another process) at this exact moment,
# and a read-modify-write without it drops whichever change lost the race.
