"""The project queue's dispatcher — one folder, one owner, one spawn site.

See design.md ("Queue manager — PR 2"). The signatures here are the contract the
doors, the listing and the event transport build against.

Vocabulary: a *folder* is `project_queue.queue_key(target)`; a *task key* is
the Tasks page key (a session id, or ``pending:<entry id>``). The index is a
rebuildable pointer table persisted in STATE_DIR as ``queue_index.json``.

**Nothing here polls and nothing here reads a registry.** State moves only on the
events below, and the three facts the manager cannot derive — how to start a
turn, how to replay a held card decision, whether a task is running or blocked —
are injected callables, and neither of the slow two is ever called with the
queue lock held (`_txn`). That is what makes the dispatcher testable without a
process, and what keeps `reconcile()` honest: the index is a cache of pointers
whose truth lives in the scheduler store and the status sync.

        Starting a turn and replaying a card decision are injected callables
        that talk to the disk and to another process. Holding the queue lock
        across one of them made every event that arrived in that window — a card
        going up in another folder, a turn ending in a third — wait on a spawn
        it had nothing to do with. So `_pump` only DECIDES under the lock: it
        pops the head of the line and files it as a `starting` owner with one
        `since` stamp. `_flush` then does the work with the lock released and
        re-takes it for microseconds to patch the result in.

        Handlers use the `_`-prefixed internals inside, so a pump nested in an
        enqueue is still one write and one notify.

        BELT: a handler that reorders a folder's line, or lets a removal/

        task's key to `keys` — that bug is easy to reintroduce one folder
        mutation at a time (skip's "both A and B claim 1st in line", PR

        the body ran to after: any task whose `(index, ahead_key)` moved gets
        added. A pure append (nothing existing shifted) adds nothing extra —
        the new key is already `keys.add()`-ed by the handler — so this never
        over-fires on the common case. A REORDER of the very same set of line

        `_claim_folder`, the pump. One send crosses several doors on its way

        and a `started` that counted too turned one send into more than one
        turn, so `turn_ended`'s single decrement never brought the count back
        to zero and the folder never freed (Bugbot, PR #1194).

        This only replaces an `admit:<token>` placeholder, fills in
        `run_id`/`session_id` on a matching owner, or — ONLY when the folder
        has no owner at all, a spawn `claim` never saw (the legacy/anonymous
        path) — files a fresh owner with `turns = 1`, same as any other first
        ownership.

        **A NAMELESS SEND IS FILED UNDER ITS RUN.** A brand-new chat's first
        send has no session — Claude Code mints one somewhere inside the spawn
        — so there was nothing to call the task and `started` filed nobody,
        which left the folder reading free and let a second nameless send into
        it while the first was still starting. The run id is a name: it exists
        the moment `_start` returns, the page carries it on every message

        whose spawn reached here some other way — both name a real conversation
        the placeholder never had. The one thing only the admitted send could
        have presented is the placeholder's own claim token, and
        `consume_claim` marks the owner the instant that happens
        (`owner["consumed"]`); this refuses (logs, does nothing) rather than
        replace a live, unconsumed placeholder on a guess. The run gate
        (`routers/run.py::_folder_busy`) is the real fix — `is_free` no longer
        calls a live placeholder free to a stranger, so that send is refused
        before it ever reaches a spawn — this is the backstop for a caller
        that reaches `started` some other way. An EXPIRED placeholder still

        Bugbot PR #1194, third round). `admit:<token>` is what an admission
        leaves for a chat that has no name yet, and it used to read free to
        EVERY caller — which let a brand-new chat's first `/api/run start`
        with no session, no run and no claim token pass a folder another
        admission had already reserved: two brand-new chats spawned in one

        `is_free` takes no token and a caller with no name yet has nothing else
        to offer. `task_key=""` — a stranger with no name at all — is

        WHAT THE STATUS WORD CANNOT SAY (delete/erase, PR #1194). A run parked
        on a card the user has already answered reads `queued` rather than
        `needs_attention` (`_parked_runs`'s fourth condition), so the row a
        door is looking at describes a task that is WAITING and a task that is
        RUNNING with the same word. The line says whether a message is waiting;
        this says whether a process is live.

        STANDING IN A LINE IS NOT THIS. A queued message has no process yet, so
        deleting it interrupts nothing — the door deletes it and `remove` takes
        it out of the line.

        ASKED OF THE STATUS SYNC, not of the index alone: an owner whose
        process died sits in the file until the next `reconcile`, and a guard
        that trusted the index would refuse to delete a task nothing is running

        safe direction here too — a refusal the user can retry, rather than a
        tombstone over a live turn.

        A stale `admit:` placeholder is no process at all (`is_free` reads it
        the same way): nothing ever came back for it, so it holds nothing.

        TWO STATES THE SYNC CANNOT BE ASKED ABOUT, answered the way `reconcile`
        answers them (Bugbot, PR #1254). A `starting` owner whose spawn has not
        returned has no run id yet — there is nothing to look up, and the
        process is being created as this is read — so it is live for as long
        as the spawn is in flight (`_spawning`) or inside `SPAWN_GRACE`. And a
        resume marker in the line (`card_cleared`) is not a queued message but
