"""A .py's project folder, and that folder's central venv.

A script's environment is a property of the FOLDER it belongs to, declared once
in that folder's `pyproject.toml` — not of anything written inside the file
(SPEC PY-16). Every `.py` under a project root runs in the same environment
however deep it sits, so one page calling five scripts installs one environment.

The boundary is resolved BEFORE the manifest is looked for, and in a fixed order:

  1. the app folder (`app_git.app_dir_for` — exactly `<fused_dir()>/<tag>/<name>`)
  2. an immediate child of a template root (the user override dir, the staged
     core copy, the dev override, and the in-package source tree)
  3. otherwise, the TOPMOST ancestor that holds a `pyproject.toml`

Topmost, not nearest, and structural containers first, because a manifest that
looks correct but is inert is the exact failure mode D177 was written about: a
stray `readers/pyproject.toml` inside an app must not quietly give `readers/`
its own environment while the rest of the app uses another. Inside a container
the container always wins; outside one, the outermost declaration wins.

Storage follows MD-7 for the declaration (`pyproject.toml`, `uv.lock`): it is
source and lives with the user's code. The venv, unlike the declaration, is
derived state, and for a folder the app can write to it now lives INSIDE that
folder, at `<project_dir>/.venv` — the layout `uv run`, VS Code and this app's
own notebook kernel picker (`templates/notebook/kernel.py`'s `.venv` walk)
already expect, for free. "Derived state never lands in the user's tree" was
MD-7's original reading of this and is now the fallback rather than the rule:
a folder that cannot hold a `.venv` — a read-only in-package runner folder
(D376), an unwritable mount, or `FUSED_RENDER_VENV_IN_TREE=0` — still gets one
at `<home_dir()>/venvs/<sha256 of the folder's identity>[:16]>`, never as a
sidecar dropped into a tree that cannot take it. See `venv_dir_for` for the
exact predicate and its order. The uv cache sits beside the home store under
the same home dir ONLY when
`FUSED_RENDER_HOME` is explicitly set (see `uv_cache_dir()`) — that used to
be unconditional and fragmented the cache per branch/worktree as a result;
ordinarily uv is left to pick its own default cache instead, trading the
one-filesystem hardlink guarantee for never redownloading a multi-gigabyte
wheel per branch again.

The path is hashed AS GIVEN (abspath, not realpath), with ONE exception: a project
folder that ships inside the app (the AI runner folders) is keyed on its path
relative to the `fused_render_app` package, because the app's own path is not stable —
the AppImage's mount directory is fresh on every launch. See `_venv_identity`.
That hash — `venv_key_for` — is no longer the storage path for the common,
in-tree case, but it is still the ONE per-folder identifier everything else
names a venv by: the install-progress directory, the `/api/env/progress?key=`
and `/api/env/cancel` parameters, and the install-dedup lock key all still want
a stable string that survives a request across a folder they cannot always
re-derive from scratch, and only the home-store fallback still uses it as a
literal directory name.

Hashing the path as given is a deliberate
divergence from MD-7's canonicalisation: renaming a folder in the home store
yields a fresh environment there, which is a requested feature for that case,
and the orphaned venv is reclaimed by `gc()`. An in-tree venv needs no such
rule — it lives inside the folder it belongs to, so a rename carries it along
for free; see `venv_dir_for`. The dangerous direction — two different folders
colliding on one key — remains impossible either way.

Staleness is a DIGEST comparison, never an mtime chain: `.fused-source.json`
inside the venv records the path and the sha256 of the `pyproject.toml` it was
built from. The MANIFEST, and only the manifest — `uv.lock` is an OUTPUT of
`uv sync`, so folding it in would make the environment's own side effect a reason
to rebuild the environment. mtimes are wrong here for a different reason:
`core_templates`' `copytree` uses `copy2`, so every release stamps a template's
`pyproject.toml` newer than its venv and an mtime rule would resync
byte-identical dependencies on every upgrade. See `state_digest`.

This module is consulted on every `/api/run`, so it imports nothing from
`fused.*` — pulling the engine in would cost its whole import tree (pandas and
friends, historically geopandas/pyproj too) on the request path.

    otherwise, which is the caller's cue to let uv pick its OWN default
    cache (`_env_install_worker._build` is the one caller, and the sentinel
    that survives the trip through argv — see its module docstring).

    `None` means WE have no opinion, not that `UV_CACHE_DIR` must be
    absent: `_build`'s environment starts as a plain copy of `os.environ`,
    so an AMBIENT `UV_CACHE_DIR` — set by the shell, by CI's own
    `setup-uv` action, by anything upstream of this process — rides along
    untouched and wins, exactly as it would for uv invoked directly. Actively
    deleting it here would be imposing a different cache choice ("no
    override"), which is precisely what this function exists to STOP
    doing.

    **This used to always be `<home_dir()>/uv-cache`, and per-branch
    fragmentation was the result — composition, not a decision.** Branch
    nesting landed first (`a8f50e2f`, 20 Jul: `home_dir()` nests under
    `branches/<ref>/` so parallel branches don't collide). This function
    landed later (#409, 7 Aug) BUILT ON `home_dir()`, with exactly one
    stated reason for the path it chose — cache and venvs must share a
    filesystem, or uv silently falls back to copying instead of
    hardlinking. Nobody deciding that ALSO decided a cache should fragment
    per branch; it fell out of `home_dir()` having quietly become
    branch-aware by the time this was written on top of it. The measured
    cost on one machine: three worktrees each held their OWN copy of a
    multi-gigabyte torch download (15G, 14G, 1.2G under `branches/*/uv-cache`)
    while `~/.cache/uv` — 68G, and mounted on the SAME filesystem as every
    one of them — already had it. A ROCm install re-downloaded 3.4GB it did
    not need to.

    **Deferring to uv's own default gives up the one-filesystem guarantee
    that made hardlinking work BY CONSTRUCTION, and that trade is
    deliberate, not a free win.** uv's default is platform-specific (XDG on
    Linux, `~/.cache/uv` on macOS too — NOT `~/Library/Caches`, which
    strengthens rather than weakens the one-filesystem argument, since
    `~/.cache` and `~/.fused-render` are typically the same volume —
    `%LOCALAPPDATA%` on Windows) and this module does not hardcode any of
    them — only uv itself gets to decide, correctly, which one applies. A
    user whose app home and that default cache happen to sit on DIFFERENT
    filesystems loses hardlinking and pays full copies again from here on,
    silently. That is accepted because the alternative — a fresh
    multi-gigabyte redownload per branch or worktree, guaranteed, on every
    machine — is worse than a possible, machine-dependent loss of a dedup
    optimisation.

    **This trade reaches fewer users than it looks like it does.**
    `FUSED_RENDER_HOME` is not only the test suite's isolation — the
    PACKAGED Linux and Windows desktop app sets it too, unconditionally,
    for every launch (`supervisor.paths.DesktopPaths.self_environment`/
    `child_environment`, D131), pointed at its own durable state dir. For
    those users the `None` branch below is UNREACHABLE: they keep the old,
    explicit sibling cache exactly as before this function existed, and
    `_env_install_worker._build` still overrides whatever `UV_CACHE_DIR`
    the supervisor's own child environment set (`$XDG_CACHE_HOME/
    fused-render/uv` on Linux — chosen there specifically to keep uv's
    disposable GBs out of backup scope, a goal this sibling-cache override
    already worked against before this function changed at all). Only a
    macOS packaged build (which does not go through that supervisor
    environment) and a source/dev checkout with no `FUSED_RENDER_HOME` of
    their own actually reach the new, deferred-to-uv's-default behaviour
    this function was written for. Whether the packaged desktop app SHOULD
    get the shared/default cache too is an open question this change
    deliberately does not answer — it would mean editing
    `supervisor/paths.py`'s own environment, a decision for whoever owns
    that file's contract, not a side effect of this one.

    `UV_LINK_MODE` stays unset either way — uv already prefers hardlinks

def _venv_identity(project_dir: str) -> str:
    """What *project_dir* is, for keying purposes: its path, or its path IN the app.

    An absolute path is the right identity for a folder of the user's — it is
    stable for as long as the folder is where it was, and moving the folder is
    meant to yield a fresh environment (see the module docstring).

    It is the WRONG identity for a folder that ships inside the app, because on
    two of the three packaged builds the app's own path is not stable:

      * the AppImage runs from a squashfs mount whose directory name is fresh on
        every launch (`~/.fused-render/temp/.mount_FusedRxxxxxx/…`)
      * the macOS .app can be run from the DMG, from `/Applications`, or from
        wherever the user dragged it

    Keying those on the absolute path means the bundled AI runner folders get a
    new venv key on every launch: the multi-gigabyte torch/ctranslate2 environment
    built last time is still on disk, still correct, and unreachable, so the user
    re-downloads it — and `gc()` cannot even reclaim the old one (it keeps venvs
    whose source is merely unreachable, and a vanished mount is exactly that).
    Relativising against the package makes the identity `<fused_render_app>/ai/runners/
    faster_whisper`, which is the same string on every launch and across upgrades.

    Across upgrades is intended, not a leak: staleness is a digest of the
    manifest (`state_digest`), so a release that edits a runner's dependencies
    rebuilds that environment and a release that does not keeps it. That is the
    same rule a user's folder lives by.

    One consequence worth naming, and it is a real one rather than a developer's
    corner: any two copies of `fused_render_app` on one machine share these keys, since
    both are a package with the same relative folders inside it. `home_dir()` is
    `~/.fused-render` for every copy without a `FUSED_RENDER_BRANCH`, so an old
    and a new AppImage kept side by side — or an AppImage plus a `pip install`, or
    either plus a source checkout — share one venv and one manifest mirror per
    runner. While their manifests agree that is the whole point (nobody downloads
    torch twice). When they differ, the digest check makes them ALTERNATE: each
    launch of the other copy rebuilds the runner it uses, instead of the two
    coexisting.

    That is the accepted cost, not an oversight. Reuse across launches and across
    upgrades is what this identity is FOR, and folding an install identity (a
    build hash, an app path) into the key would defeat exactly that — the AppImage
    would be back to a fresh key per launch. Two copies of the app that are
    actively used in alternation is a rarer situation than one copy relaunched,
    and its cost is a rebuild rather than a wrong answer.

    carries next to the dependency that needs it, rather than a hardcoded name
    list in Python that a new runner's author would have no reason to know
    about. Every bundled AI runner installs through `envinstall.start` with
    `allow_build` defaulting to False (PY-18's wheels-only rule) — this is the
    one, folder-declared way a runner can ask for the opposite, for the one
    reason that ever justifies it: a dependency with no PyPI release and no
    wheels, where `--no-build` cannot possibly succeed (see
    `ai/runners/ltx_video/pyproject.toml`'s header for the worked example).

    Absent, not a table, or `allow_build` missing/falsy all read as False —
    the safe default for the hundred-odd folders that never touch this table
    at all. Only `allow_build = true` (a literal bool; `"true"` the string
    does not count, same discipline `background_apps.py` applies to its own
    flags) opts in.

    **Coupling a caller must not miss:** `_env_install_worker._build` appends
    `--no-build` and `--no-install-project` TOGETHER, only when `allow_build`
    is False (see that function's own docstring for why they ride together —
    `--no-build` alone would also refuse to build the local project the
    instant it declares `[build-system]`, which a bare `uv init` scaffold
    does by default). So opting in here also drops `--no-install-project`,
    which re-enables installing the RUNNER'S OWN FOLDER as a project into its
    venv. That is harmless only when the folder also declares
    `[tool.uv] package = false` (a folder of scripts, not a distribution) —
    true of `ai/runners/ltx_video/pyproject.toml` today, but for an unrelated
    reason nothing here enforces. A runner that opts into `allow_build`
    without also declaring `package = false` gets its own folder built and
    installed, and in a packaged app that folder is read-only.
    `tests/test_ai_runner_deps.py`'s
    `test_an_opted_in_runner_also_declares_package_false` checks this pairing

    else in the manifest is an ordinary PyPI requirement, and the prompt shows
    NONE of those: naming the common case is what turns a question into a
    reflex, so silence here is deliberate, not a gap.

    Three shapes, all readable from the manifest (and, for shape 3, from
    `uv.toml` alongside it — see that shape's own note) — no network, no
    resolution, so this can run on the request path:

    1. A PEP 508 direct reference right in `[project].dependencies`
       (`foo @ https://.../foo.whl`, or a VCS form `foo @ git+https://...`).
       The requirement names its own source; there is no "a released version
       of foo" for it to mean.
    2. A `[tool.uv.sources]` entry that routes a plain-looking `dependencies`
       name (`foolib`) to a `git`/`url`/`path`/`workspace`/`index`. Read
       `dependencies` alone and this looks like an ordinary PyPI name — only
       the sources table says otherwise, which is exactly why a name-only
       prompt would otherwise miss it. uv also accepts a LIST of source
       tables for one name (platform-conditional sources, each with its own
       `marker`) — every entry in the list is checked, not just a first one
       assumed to be a dict, so a git/url/path/workspace source confined to
       one platform's entry is still named rather than silently skipped.
    3. A project-wide custom index: `[tool.uv]`'s `index-url`/`default-index`/
       `extra-index-url`, or a `[[tool.uv.index]]` table with no
       `explicit = true` — read from `uv.toml` too (same key names, at the
       top level rather than nested under `[tool.uv]` — see
       `_load_uv_toml`), since `uv sync` obeys either file for this folder
       and a private index declared only in `uv.toml` is exactly as capable
       of routing every package somewhere else as one declared in
       `pyproject.toml`. This is not a fact about any one dependency — it is
       a candidate source for EVERY requirement in the graph — so it is
       reported once, under the index's host, instead of against whichever
       dependencies happen to resolve from it. An `explicit` index is the
       opposite case: confined to whatever `[tool.uv.sources]` routes to it
       by name, so it carries no risk beyond what shape 2 already reports for
       that one entry, and is left out here.

    Order and duplicates are not contracts callers rely on; this only ever

    that just broke something this folder asked for", after the fact.

    **Its output must NOT be turned into a pre-flight refusal.** That was tried
    and it broke five templates that had been working for months: `docs`,
    `geotiff`, `latex`, `model_card` and `pano` each declare a heavy optional
    dependency while their entry points stay stdlib-only on purpose —
    `geotiff`'s `ensure()`, and `model_card`'s manifest promising the card
    "renders identically under either engine". A non-empty list here means the
    folder declares something absent; it does NOT mean this run needs it, and
    almost every run does not (D276). The distinction is the entire lesson.

    "This interpreter" is `sys.executable` itself, asked in-process through
    `importlib.metadata` — deliberately NOT `engine.app_satisfies`, which probes
    a *candidate* interpreter in a subprocess because the fused backend may run
    children on one that is not this process. The built-in executor spawns
    `sys.executable`, so the question here has a local answer and paying a
    subprocess probe for it would be absurd.

    Only the name is checked, never the version specifier: an unsatisfied `>=` is
    a much weaker claim than an absent distribution, and attributing a failure to
    a floor the app is one release away from meeting would point the reader at
    the wrong thing. `uv` still enforces the specifier wherever a real
    environment gets built.

    Every uncertain answer is "present", the same three-valued discipline

    OUTPUT of `uv sync`, not an input to it, so folding it in would make the
    environment's own side effect a reason to rebuild the environment. The
    declaration is the manifest, and the manifest is what decides staleness.

    That the manifest is hashed at all — rather than the lock, on the reasoning
    that the lock is the resolved truth — is the requirement this exists for: a
    user adding a dependency must have it picked up by OUR OWN install flow, not
    only by a `uv sync` they happen to have run by hand. An in-tree venv sits
    exactly where a hand `uv sync` would build it, but a hand build writes no
    marker and no sidecar (`envinstall.READY_MARKER`, `write_sidecar`) — those
    are what `is_installed` actually trusts — so hashing the lock would let a
    hand-built `uv.lock` read as "already resolved for this manifest" and skip
    the marker step forever. Hashing the lock instead meant such an edit changed
    nothing, `sidecar_matches` said fresh, no install was offered, and the run
    failed later on an ImportError with no loader and no explanation. The cost in
    the other direction is a resync for a comment edit, which is a fast no-op
    through uv's cache — a silently ignored dependency edit is a broken app.

    The intended consequence: a hand-edit to `uv.lock` ALONE does not trigger a
    resync. The lock is generated; the manifest is the declaration. (The sync it
    would have triggered runs bare rather than `--frozen`, so uv reconciles the
    lock itself whenever the manifest moves — see `_env_install_worker._build`.)

    Still a digest and never an mtime chain, for the reason in the module
    docstring: core templates are re-staged with `copy2` on every release, so an
    mtime rule would resync byte-identical dependencies at every upgrade.

    Memoised per process on a `(st_ino, st_size, st_mtime_ns)` fingerprint,
    because `is_installed` calls this on every `/api/run`: the steady state is
    one `stat`. The memo is process-local and dies with the app process, which is
    what keeps it safe across upgrades — there is no persisted verdict to go
    stale. Its one blind spot is an edit that preserves BOTH size and nanosecond
    mtime, which needs two writes inside a single filesystem timestamp tick; the
    fingerprint is deliberately not strengthened past that, since the alternative
    is re-reading the file on every request to close a window nothing can
    realistically hit.

    Load-bearing, not housekeeping, for two separate reasons now:

      * keying a home-store venv on the path means moving or renaming a project
        orphans it by design, so without this the store grows by one full
        environment every rename;
      * the in-tree default (`venv_dir_for`) means a venv that was built back
        when everything lived in the home store now has a project that
        disagrees about where its venv belongs — the folder is writable, is
        not in the package, and the escape hatch is not set, so every fresh
        request for it gets `<project>/.venv` instead. The home-store copy is
        then a directory nothing will ever read again. RELOCATED, in the
        return value's log line, names this second case; the first stays GONE.

    Returns the number removed either way.

    Two things are deliberately LEFT ALONE, both because this runs unattended at
    every server startup and a wrong deletion costs the user a full re-download:

      * a venv with no readable sidecar — it may be an install in flight, and
        deleting one out from under a running worker is worse than leaking it;
      * a venv whose source is merely UNREACHABLE rather than deleted, e.g. on an
        unplugged external drive. See `_source_is_deleted`. This is also what
        keeps the relocation arm safe: an unreachable folder fails the
        writability probe (it cannot even be statted), so `venv_dir_for`
        answers the home store for it too — the same directory this loop is
        looking at — and it is therefore never read as "relocated". Reordering
        this so relocation were checked before existence would delete a
        multi-gigabyte venv the instant its volume is unplugged, which is
        exactly the failure `_source_is_deleted` exists to prevent; a test
        pins this (`test_gc_keeps_a_home_store_venv_whose_source_folder_is_
        unreachable`).

    A manifest mirror (`<key>.src`) is reclaimed in two situations, and only
    those: with the venv it belongs to, and when there is NO `<key>` directory at
    all. The second is not tidiness — a mirror has no sidecar, so the loop below
    skips it on its own account, and a build that never produced a venv (a
    resolver failure, a project deleted between the sync starting and finishing)
    left one that nothing would ever look at again. It is only a few KB, but it is
    a few KB that accumulates once per failed install and is invisible to every
    other mechanism here. A mirror BESIDE a live venv is still never touched
    alone: it holds the lock that venv was resolved from.

    That does mean a mirror can be taken out from under a FIRST install running
    right now, for as long as its venv directory does not exist yet. The worker
    only creates the venv's PARENT before spawning uv, so what closes the window
    is uv itself creating the environment — which it does before it resolves, so
    the exposure is the sliver between the mirror appearing and uv getting that
    far, not the resolve and download the user actually waits through. `gc` runs
    once at server startup, so hitting it means a first read-only install began
    within about a second of the server booting.

    The cost is bounded at what the mirror is worth: uv writes its lock into an
    unlinked directory and the next build re-resolves. The venv itself, and
    therefore the install the user is waiting on, is unaffected.

    Returns the count of VENVS reclaimed — mirrors are not counted, because the
    number is what startup logs as "reclaimed N orphaned project venv(s)" and a
    stray few KB is not that.
