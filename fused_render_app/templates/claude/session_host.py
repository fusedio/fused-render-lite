"""A session host owns the CLAUDE CLI's stdin for the life of a chat session.

`_start` (agent.py) used to Popen the CLI directly, once, for a single turn:
argv in, one message on stdin, EOF, `-p` exits. That made every follow-up a
NEW process — no way for the CLI to keep background work running between
turns, and no way for a mid-turn message to reach a turn already in flight.

This module is the process that changes that. `_start` detaches ONE of these
per session (not per turn) and hands it a JSON request on stdin (never argv —
the request may carry the user's own text-bearing paths, and argv is visible
to every local user via `ps`). This host then:

  1. Spawns the CLAUDE CLI itself, using the SAME argv `_start` used to build
     inline (now `agent._claude_argv`), with its OWN stdin held open as a
     pipe — so the CLI is never told to expect EOF after one message.
  2. Overwrites `run_dir/pid` with the CLI's own pid (not this host's) —
     `_cancel`'s `killpg` needs the CLI's process-group root, not this
     wrapper's, to reach the whole tree it may spawn.
  3. Drains `run_dir/inbox/*.json` into the CLI's stdin pipe in name order,
     moving each to `inbox/done/` once written — the first entry is the
     turn's own opening message (written by `_start`), every later one a
     follow-up (written by `_send`, a later task in this plan).
  4. Watches `agent._turn_state(run_dir)` — the SAME read `_live_run` and
     `_poll` use, off `out.jsonl` alone — and reaps (closes the CLI's stdin,
     lets both processes exit) once that has read `(turn_open=False,
     tasks_pending=False)` continuously for `_IDLE_REAP_SECONDS`. Nothing
     here re-derives that answer differently; a second implementation of
     "is this session still doing something" is a second answer.

Like every other file in this package (D-whatever governs
`templates/claude/`), this module is stdlib-only and never imports
`fused_render` — it is loaded by file path (`importlib.util
.spec_from_file_location`), the same way `claude_spawn.load_agent` loads
`agent.py` itself, and it must keep working if this whole directory is
copied out and run standalone.

Fork-safety (see `claude_spawn.py`'s own comment on this): this process is
ALREADY a bare Python interpreter with no `libproj` ever loaded — it exists
BECAUSE the server process cannot safely `fork()` (PROJ's atfork handler
SIGSEGVs on a post-fork sqlite handle). `_start` reaches this file only from
inside that same already-isolated subprocess (the `python -c` helper spawned
by `claude_spawn.spawn_helper`), so every `fork()` this module's own Popen
calls trigger (detaching, or spawning the CLI with a `cwd`) is happening in a
process that was never going to load `libproj` in the first place.

    CreateProcess's own documented handling of a `.bat`/`.cmd` target reroutes
    the ENTIRE call through `%ComSpec% /c <original command line>` — cmd.exe,
    not the batch file, is what actually receives argv, as one command-line
    string. cmd.exe's `/c` parser then scans that WHOLE string for its own
    operators (`< > & | ^`) wherever they fall, quotes or no — double quotes
    protect a token from being split on whitespace, but do NOT stop cmd.exe
    from reading a `<`/`>` inside one as real redirection. `_claude_argv`'s
    `--append-system-prompt` text is not test-only content that could be
    written around this — it is the product's own boilerplate (the
    `<live-app-state>` tag mentioned in every prompt, D239) — so any `.bat`/
    `.cmd`-resolved `claude` (an npm install on Windows installs exactly one
    of these two, `_WINDOWS_CANDIDATES` still lists `.cmd` after `.exe`) hits
    a cmd.exe parse of `<live-app-state>` as "redirect stdin from a file
    named live-app-state", which does not exist — cmd.exe errors out and
    never reaches the batch file's own body, so the CLI never launches at
    all, on every single turn.

    The fix is `cmd.exe /c`'s own documented escape hatch (`cmd /?`, the
    fallback rule below its "no special characters between the quotes"
    case): when the argument to `/c` begins and ends with a double quote,
    cmd strips exactly that one outer pair and runs the interior literally,
    without re-scanning it for redirection. Building the whole line with
    `subprocess.list2cmdline` (correct Win32 argv quoting, the same
    encoding `subprocess.Popen(list, ...)` would have produced) and wrapping
    the result in one more pair of quotes lands exactly in that fallback —
    the interior text reaches `claude.bat`/`claude.cmd`'s own CreateProcess
    call untouched, `<live-app-state>` included. `subprocess.Popen` accepts
    a plain string as `args` and uses it as the literal Win32 command line
    (no further quoting), which is what makes the wrapped string usable
    here at all.

    Left as `argv` (the list form) whenever `argv[0]` is NOT a `.bat`/`.cmd`
    — including every POSIX launch, and a native `.exe` `claude` on Windows
    — since CreateProcess talks directly to a real executable there and
    never involves cmd.exe or its redirection scan."""

# a no-op whenever the flag is off, so a lost one costs nothing the queue can
# feel. No origin in the environment (this host started standalone, or from an
# older server) means there is nobody to tell, and we skip it silently.
