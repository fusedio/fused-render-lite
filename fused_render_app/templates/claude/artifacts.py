"""runPython target for claude/template.html's Artifacts section: the pages
Claude PUBLISHED while working on this target.

An artifact is the one thing a chat produces that outlives the chat and does not
live on disk — a hosted page on claude.ai. The transcript records it and then
scrolls away, so a folder someone has published five pages from looks, on the
landing screen, exactly like one that has published none. This module is what
the landing screen asks so it can say otherwise, and what the live chat asks so
a page announces itself the moment it is published rather than at the next
reload.

TWO readers, because the two questions are genuinely different and only one of
them is cheap:

* **`list`** — the artifacts published while working on THIS target, across
  every session, whose local source is still on disk. The cross-session scan
  (every transcript under ~/.claude/projects, plus a per-url merge of
  redeploys) is the SERVER's job and already done there
  (`/api/claude-artifacts`, cached): this action is an HTTP call to it, scoped
  by `cwd`, and then two filters the server cannot apply because they are about
  the TARGET rather than the directory — see `_list`. It deliberately does not
  reimplement the scan: a second implementation of "which artifacts exist" is
  how the two grow apart, and the server's is the one with the cache, the
  `exists` probe and the description/favicon join.
* **`live`** — the artifacts in ONE session's transcript, read straight off
  disk. Called on a timer while a run streams, which is exactly when the server
  cannot help: its answer is cached, and the frame-link that a publish just
  appended is a single line in a file whose name we already know. One `open()`
  of one transcript is cheaper than a cache invalidation would be, and it is
  never stale by construction.

The server is reached the sanctioned way — `../shared/appenv.origin()`, i.e. the
`FUSED_RENDER_ORIGIN` the app exports — because a template may not import
`fused_render` (SPEC PY-15). Stdlib otherwise.

NOTHING HERE RAISES. Both actions are decoration on a screen whose subject is a
conversation: an unset origin, a refused connection, a transcript that was
rotated away are all ordinary, and the honest answer to every one of them is an
empty list (plus `error` for the console) rather than the red traceback overlay
over a working chat.

Actions:
  main(action="list", file=...)                  -> {"artifacts": [...]}
      newest first, the server's own order. Entries carry file_path, exists
      (always true — see `_list`), remote_url, title, description, favicon,
      session_id, cwd, created_at, updated_at.
  main(action="live", session_id=..., file=...)  -> {"artifacts": [...]}
      oldest first (publish order), one session only. Entries carry
      remote_url, title, file_path, favicon, timestamp.
