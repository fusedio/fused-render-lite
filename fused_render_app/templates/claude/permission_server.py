"""Minimal stdio MCP server whose tools are "ask the browser" and "read the page".

Claude Code runs headless in this template (`claude -p`), so the CLI has no
terminal to put a permission prompt on: anything the session's rules don't
already allow was denied with "tool requires user interaction; no prompt
available in headless mode", invisibly, and the user just saw Claude give up.
`--permission-prompt-tool` names an MCP tool the CLI calls *instead* of
prompting, and this file is that tool. Each request is written to a file in the
run's `perm/` directory and the call blocks until `agent.py` drops a decision
next to it — that decision being the user's click in the chat UI.

The second tool is the same trick pointed the other way. This template is the
SPLIT view: the left pane renders the app the user is looking at, and the agent
edits it blind — after an edit it cannot see whether the page came back or
threw. `app_state` parks a request the same way, and the page answers it with a
snapshot of that iframe (console errors, params, a bounded DOM outline). It is
a read of the user's own screen for the agent they are already talking to, so
it raises no card; `agent.py` pre-allows it.

Spawned by `claude`, never by the app: stdlib only, no `fused_render` import,
no assumption about cwd. Up to two directories arrive as argv (tmp paths, not
secrets): argv[1] holds the permission round trip, argv[2] the app-state one.
Separate directories on purpose — the page renders every file in the perm dir
as an approval card, and a snapshot request is not something to click.

argv[2] is OPTIONAL, and its absence is the whole switch for the second tool: a
target with no left pane (an ordinary folder, D239) has no page to read back, so
`agent.py` spawns us with the perm dir alone and `app_state` then appears in
neither `tools/list` nor the dispatch. A tool the model can call but that can
never answer is worse than no tool — it gets called after every edit and times
out, once per turn.

Wire contract (Claude Code CLI, verified against 2.1.220):

    in   {"tool_name": str, "input": {...}, "tool_use_id": str}
    out  exactly one text block whose text is JSON —
         {"behavior": "allow", "updatedInput": {...}}
         {"behavior": "deny",  "message": str}          (message is required)

    "allow for the rest of this session" additionally returns
    `updatedPermissions: [{"type": "addRules", rules: [{"toolName": ...}],
    "behavior": "allow", "destination": "session"}]`, which hands the matching
    to the CLI's own rule engine rather than to a hand-rolled one here.

ONE tool is not an approval at all: `AskUserQuestion` is the model asking the
user something, and its answer rides back on the SAME allow — `updatedInput` =
the parked input plus a top-level `answers` record keyed by the exact question
text, value = the chosen option's `label` (multi-select: the chosen labels
joined with ", "). Verified against 2.1.226; the field is declared by the tool's
own input schema, which is not in `--help` (read out of the binary, then
confirmed end to end). The two shapes that look right and are not: a plain
`allow` reaches the model as "The user did not answer the questions", and a
`deny` carrying the answer as its message arrives as `is_error: true` filed
under `permission_denials`. `updatedInput` is re-validated against the tool's
schema, so it must be the parked input PLUS the key — dropping `questions` is a
`<tool_use_error>`, not a silent no-op. The card also always offers an "Other"
box the model did not author (D407, the CLI's own prompt does the same); what the
user types there rides on the decision file as `custom` and reaches the CLI as
both the answer AND a new option appended to that question in `questions`, so the
label check the CLI runs over the answer finds it.

ONE more tool needs nothing here, and that is worth writing down because it looks
like it should: `ExitPlanMode` (the model asking to stop planning) rides the
ORDINARY paths. Spiked against 2.1.226: a plain `allow` is enough — the CLI leaves
plan mode itself when it sees one (it emits `system/status
permissionMode:"default"`, the tool_result reads "User has approved your plan…"),
so the plan passes back through `updatedInput` byte-identical like any other
input, and "keep planning" is an ordinary `deny` whose `message` agent.py
composes. Whatever the page sends as an ANSWER is still refused for it, by the
`ANSWERABLE_TOOL` gate below: only a question can carry `answers`.

The JSON-RPC framing is newline-delimited JSON on stdin/stdout (MCP stdio).
stdout carries protocol only — diagnostics go to stderr.

    The client on the other end of these pipes is Node: it writes
    `JSON.stringify(message) + "\\n"`, which leaves non-ASCII UNESCAPED and goes
    out as UTF-8. Python decodes a PIPE at the locale encoding, and that is
    UTF-8 on macOS and on Linux (where a C/POSIX locale additionally turns
    PEP 540 UTF-8 mode on) but the ANSI code page on Windows — cp1252 on a
    typical Western install, which leaves 0x81/0x8D/0x8F/0x90/0x9D UNDEFINED.

    Those five bytes are ordinary UTF-8 continuation bytes, so on Windows the
    first typographic character in a tool payload killed this server outright:
    `Write` an index.html containing a curly quote (U+201D is E2 80 9D) and the
    read loop in `main` raised UnicodeDecodeError *before* the request was
    parked. No card ever appeared in the chat, the CLI's pending `approve` call
    died with the transport, and the turn went nowhere — "it just got stuck
    writing index.html", with no prompt to answer and nothing in the run dir to
    say why. Nothing about it was rare: model-written HTML is full of curly
    quotes, en dashes and emoji.

    Two halves ship, because either can be absent. agent.py stamps `PYTHONUTF8`
    into this server's env (the CLI's MCP client passes an allowlist of env vars
    plus that dict, so it has to be named there to survive at all); this is the
    half that does not depend on the client forwarding an env, or on the config
    having been written by a version of agent.py that names it.

    `errors="replace"` on the way IN, deliberately: an undecodable byte costs
    one character of a payload the user is about to read on a card, and dying
    costs them the whole turn with no way to answer it. On the way OUT the JSON
    is `ensure_ascii` today, so the encoding is belt and braces — but
    `newline="\\n"` is not: a Windows text stream would otherwise turn the
    framing newline into CRLF.

    Never raises. A stream that has already been read cannot be reconfigured,
