"""runPython target for claude/template.html: chat with the Claude Code
CLI about the target — a FOLDER (an app folder, or any other) or a file. This is
the only chat backend: it began as a fork of the plain chat template's agent
(the split view was the fork), kept every improvement that fork gained, and
absorbed the folder chat when D235 deleted the plain template and this one took
over its name.

The browser never owns the work: `start` detaches a claude subprocess whose
stream-json stdout goes to a log file in tmp; `poll` re-reads that file and
returns the accumulated assistant text so the page can render the reply as it
streams in. Stdlib only (plus ../shared/procutil).

Cross-platform: `claude` is looked up on PATH and then in the platform's known
install locations, because a Windows install commonly isn't on the PATH this
process inherited (_claude_bin); detaching, liveness and cancel each take the
win32 route where the POSIX one is absent or destructive (_DETACH, _alive,
_cancel).

Sessions are per-file. Claude runs with cwd = the target file's directory and
an appended system prompt that scopes it (softly) to the file.

The session LIST is the transcripts sitting in this cwd's ~/.claude/projects
dir — every chat about the same folder, whether started here or in a terminal.
Still not the global history; still scoped to this one cwd. See `_sessions`.

Tool approvals are the browser's to give: claude is spawned with a
`--permission-prompt-tool` pointing at `permission_server.py` (a one-tool stdio
MCP server), which parks each request as a file under the run's `perm/` dir.
`poll` hands those to the page, `decide` writes the answer back, and the
blocked claude subprocess picks it up.

    whether the system prompt describes a page beside the chat. Only one target

    THE PAGE IS AUTHORITATIVE, NOT THIS FUNCTION, and `_start` prefers the page's
    answer whenever it is given one (`has_pane`). The question is "is there a page
    beside this chat", and only the page can answer it: `paneURL()` runs ONCE, in
    the boot IIFE, and `enterNoPane()` removes `#left` permanently — there is no
    re-resolution on the page side and there cannot be, because a pane cannot
    appear mid-session. Asking disk per turn therefore drifted, in both

    the page has no pane to answer with (the model calls it, `answerAppState`
    burns its null polls and replies APP_STATE_UNREADABLE — the one thing the page
    asserts can never be the answer to it); delete the entry page and the tool
    dropped while a live pane was still on screen.

    `pane` IS THE ANSWER, PASSED IN — never re-derived here. For a directory the

    asking it a second time reopened the window the single resolution in `_start`
    exists to close: an index.html appearing between the two calls (a concurrent

    transient EMFILE/EIO hitting `_is_app_dir`'s blanket `except Exception: return

    omitted the tool — while this prompt announced it. Worse than either shape
    alone: an announced tool that is not in the roster is a promise the run cannot
    keep.

    The APP-FOLDER shape carries the app-state disclosure, for the reason D235
    gave: a tool the model is never told about is a tool it never calls, and the
    tool's own description is not enough on its own — nothing in an ordinary
    session suggests that the page beside the chat can be read back. The ordinary
    folder does NOT, because since D239 it has no pane and therefore no tool
    (`_has_pane`). What the two shapes must never share is the description of the
    pane, exactly as the file branch above does not share the folder branch's.

    * An APP FOLDER (`app_entry` resolves an entry page) keeps today's wording.
      Naming fused-render belongs HERE rather than being left to the starter
      `CLAUDE.md`: that file is the user's, in their folder, and a session opened
      on a project whose CLAUDE.md was edited away — or that predates it —
      otherwise has nothing telling it the HTML in front of it is an app with a
      Python bridge behind it. Same reliability argument as the skill plugin

      says what the project IS, not what to work on.
    * An ORDINARY FOLDER gets the folder-scoping instruction, ported verbatim
      from the deleted plain chat template's own directory prompt rather than
      reinvented, so the folder chat reads the same as it always did. Saying
      "this is a fused-render project: its HTML is an app fused-render serves"
      here would be a plain lie about `~/Downloads`, and a lie that costs
      something: it invites the agent to look for a bridge that is not there and
      to treat a folder of PDFs as a codebase. It says NOTHING about a pane and
      does not mention `app_state`, because as of D239 there is no pane: this
      target's chat is full width and the tool is not in the run's roster at all
      (`_has_pane`). The paragraph that used to be here described fused-render's
      own file browser beside the chat and warned that `app_state` "reports the
      BROWSER, not the folder"; it went with the pane it described. A prompt that
      tells the model what the user can see beside the conversation, when there
      is nothing beside the conversation, is a false claim about the screen — and

    users actually drop — TIFF off a scanner or a GIS export, HEIC off an iPhone
    — that turned out to be false: the Read tool cannot open either, so the
    attachment was a path to bytes nobody in the conversation could look at. The
    page could see it was undecodable; it just had nowhere to send it. This is
    that somewhere, and it is on the python side because that is where Pillow and
    the OS's own decoders are.

    IT WRITES A SIBLING AND DELETES NOTHING. The original stays: it is what the
    user actually attached, the page may still want its byte count, and the

    PNG FIRST, JPEG ONLY IF PNG MISSES THE BUDGET. A screenshot, a scan and a
    diagram are the common TIFFs and all three are exactly what PNG is good at
    (and what JPEG's ringing ruins); a 12 MP photo is the common HEIC and is
    where a lossless 1600px re-encode blows past 4 MB. So the format follows the
    content instead of the extension, decided by measuring rather than guessing.

    NEVER RAISES. Every failure is `{"error": ...}` — the page's whole answer to

# WHY THE APP KEEPS ITS OWN RECORD when the transcript looks like it already
# says. `_scan_transcript` reads the model off `message.model`, which every
# assistant row carries, and the effort off a top-level `effort` key, which
# Claude Code writes only sometimes — so effort routinely read as MISSING, and
# a missing field used to be filled in from the newest OTHER chat in the folder.
# A task set up with haiku/low opened on a neighbour's max (Akshil, 2026-09-18).
# And no transcript exists at all in the seconds between a chat getting an id
# and its first row landing, which is exactly when a new task's peek is read.
#
# So every spawn (`_start`) and every send (`_send`) records what it actually
# launched with, the pill records every pick (`POST /api/tasks/settings`), and

    effect at the next spawn, so switching it to "Claude decides" mid-turn left
    the live session in the strict mode, still carding — while the card's
    "Allow, and let Claude decide from here" button, gated on that param,
    vanished from every card built afterwards.

    Derived rather than stored, so it survives a re-attach and cannot drift
    from the decisions claude actually received: the spawn mode, re-pointed by
    each landed decision that MOVED it, in the order they were answered.

    Two kinds of decision move it, and the second one is not ours:

    * an `allow` carrying a validated `setMode` — the escalation button, and the
      optional landing mode on a plan approval;
    * an `allow` on `PLAN_TOOL`, with or without a `setMode`. The CLI leaves
      plan mode ITSELF the moment it sees one (D248's spike: it emits
      `system/status permissionMode:"default"` and the tool_result reads "User
      has approved your plan…"), so a derived mode that stayed `"plan"` was
      describing a session that had already left it — and `permChoices`' plan
      guard went on suppressing the mode-switch affordance on every later card
      of the run, for a plan mode nobody was in. Where it lands mirrors the
      picker write-back at template.html's `buildPlanCard.send` exactly: the
      granted `setMode` when the approval carried one, `DEFAULT_PERMISSION_MODE`
      ("prompt", the CLI's own default) otherwise. A "keep planning" `deny`

    function so the two never drift again the way _start's inline copy could
    have).

    The session must not inherit an ambient FUSED_ENV from the server's own
    process: the `fused` wrapper (fusedcli._wrapper_text) only DEFAULTS
    FUSED_ENV when unset, so a value already present here — say the server
    itself was launched from a shell that exports FUSED_ENV for unrelated
    reasons — would look exactly like a deliberate `FUSED_ENV=x fused ...`
    from the model and skip the workbench default, silently diverging from
    canvases.py's own runs (`_cli_env` always forces FUSED_ENV=WORKBENCH_ENV,
    ambient or not). Popping it here is what makes "unset" in the wrapper
    mean what the model actually typed on that command line.

    File-history checkpoints are OFF by default in a non-interactive session,
    and every run here is non-interactive (`-p`). Without this the snapshots
    panel (SPEC §34) can only ever show versions written by a TERMINAL claude
    in that folder, and reports "no recorded versions" for every file this
    chat itself edited — the panel's own reason to exist. D394.

    An ENV VAR, not a setting: the CLI's `fileHistoryEnabled` takes a separate
    branch when `isInteractive()` is false, and that branch reads only these
    two variables — the `fileCheckpointingEnabled` config that governs the
    interactive case is not consulted, so `--settings` cannot reach it. Named
    for the SDK and absent from the public settings docs, so it may move; what
    to re-check if snapshots go quiet again is that branch.

    setdefault, because a user who exported it themselves means it: the CLI
    coerces the value properly (`1/true/yes/on`, everything else false), so a
    deliberate `=0` is an opt-out rather than a truthy string. Their
    CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_FILE_CHECKPOINTING still wins inside the CLI either

    A headless row whose pid is OURS — one of this app's own run dirs — is
    skipped rather than counted by file existence: since the session host
    shipped, that pid can sit alive well past its last turn, and `_turn_state`
    (off that run's own `out.jsonl`) already answers precisely whether a turn
    is actually open. Only a FOREIGN headless session (started at a terminal,
    invisible to RUNS) still needs this coarser heuristic."""

    the id lived in exactly one place: the `run` param on a single history entry.
    Navigating away from that entry (Back, then re-opening the chat from the
    session list) lost it for good — the detached claude process kept writing
    into RUNS/<id>/out.jsonl with nothing watching, and the chat rendered its
    half-written transcript as if the turn had never started. Asking the server
    "is anything still running for this chat?" is the missing half: `resumeRun`
    was always able to adopt a run this frame did not start.

    Matched on the TARGET first, and on the session only when the caller names
    one. Two ids can identify the same chat — the session the run resumed
    (`resumed_from` in meta.json) and the session the CLI minted for it (written
    to the `session` file by the first poll that sees one, because
    `--fork-session` can hand back a NEW id) — so either matching is a match,
    and a run with no `session` file yet falls back to the id in out.jsonl's
    head (_session_from_out), because "no poll ever ran" is precisely the state
    a Back-mid-start leaves behind.

    `limit` is how many run dirs (newest first) the scan reads; `limit=None`
    reads all of them. The default cap is right for the ORIGINAL caller — a page
    re-attaching to its own run, where a run buried under 60 newer ones belongs
    to a frame long gone — and wrong for a caller that needs a RELIABLE answer
    about a folder rather than a cheap one. canvases.py's workbench lock is that
    caller: it asks "is a session editing this clone?" to decide whether to make
    the user's other editor read-only, and a live run that fell out of the
    window would read as "nobody is editing", silently leaving the lock off.
    Nothing prunes RUNS, so on a machine that has been chatting for weeks that
    miss is the normal case, not an exotic one. Unbounded costs one meta.json
    read per run dir, so the lock caller caches the answer across its poll
    interval rather than paying it on every tick.

    This is what makes two messages typed while a turn runs land as ONE
    continuous reply instead of the page's own queue faking that with a
    second CLI process (that queue is retired — see the plan's Task 6): the
    message is written into `run_dir/inbox/` (`_write_inbox_entry`, the same
    function `_start` uses for a turn's opening message) and the session
    host already polling that directory picks it up on its next drain tick,
    whether the CLI is mid-turn (absorbed into the running turn) or idle
    (starts a fresh one on the same held-open stdin pipe).

    `read_dirs` is the SAME per-message attachment-directory string `_start`
    takes, but `--allowed-tools` is fixed at spawn time — a live session
    cannot be handed a new `Read` rule mid-session. So a message naming a
    directory the host was not already granted cannot be honored by sending:
    silently dropping the directory would card the very file the user just
    attached, so instead the whole session is ended (the same tree-kill
    `action=cancel` uses) and `{"respawn": True}` tells the caller to call
    `_start` fresh instead, which grants the new directory on the new spawn
    line. `effort` (also fixed at spawn — there is no CLI control request for
    it, unlike `model`) forces the exact same respawn when it differs from
    what the host was started with. Either way, a caller that gets
    `{"respawn": True}` must resend `message` itself through `_start` — this
    function never does that on its own, since only the caller knows the
    rest of `_start`'s arguments.

    `model` and `permission_mode`, by contrast, the CLI accepts CHANGED
    mid-session (`set_model`/`set_permission_mode` control requests, both
    verified live against 2.1.251) — a value that differs from what
    `host.json` recorded at spawn gets queued ahead of `message`, in the
    same inbox, so the CLI applies it before the turn `message` opens sees
    it. Neither is waited on the way `_cancel`'s `interrupt` is: nothing here
    needs the CLI's answer to answer ITS OWN caller, only the eventual
    `system/init`-style row the CLI writes on its own, which the page already
    reads for other reasons.

    was "the inbox directory IS the untaken set", which is true of the wire and
    false of the conversation: `session_host._drain_inbox` runs every 0.2 s and

    A FOLLOW-UP TYPED INTO A RUNNING TURN IS NOWHERE ELSE (Akshil, 2026-09-12).
    `_send` writes the message into the inbox and returns; the host ships it to
    the CLI's stdin on its next drain tick, and the CLI echoes it into
    `out.jsonl` only when it actually opens that turn — which, for a line typed
    mid-reply, is after the reply in flight has finished. Between those two
    moments the transcript has no row for the message at all, so a reload drew
    a conversation with the user's own words missing while the run that will
    answer them was still going. This is the one place that fact lives, and it
    rides on `_poll` and on `_history_live` so a chat learns it on the same
    answer it learns everything else about its run.

    TWO SETS, AND THE SECOND IS THE LONG ONE. The undrained entries are
    `inbox/*.json` — typed, on disk, not yet on the wire, which lasts a fifth
    of a second (`drained: false`). The drained-but-unechoed ones
    (`_drained_unechoed`, `drained: true`) are the rest of the wait, and on a
    turn that runs for minutes they are the whole of it: listing only the first
    set was a bubble that flashed and disappeared (Akshil's reload, 2026-09-12).
    The flag travels because the two are different kinds of undo — an undrained
    entry can still be thrown away (`_discard_inbox`), one the CLI is holding
    cannot — and a reader that has to guess would have to re-derive the whole
    rule.

    Oldest first across both, which is the order they will run: the names are
    zero-padded nanosecond stamps (`_write_inbox_row`), so sorting the names IS
    sorting by write time, and the drained ones are older than the undrained
    ones by construction.

    A `.tmp` name is skipped (a write still in flight is not an entry yet), and
    a `control_request` row is skipped because it is not words anybody typed —
    the same `type == "user"` filter `_discard_inbox` applies to the same
    directory.

    One `listdir`, and on a chat that has never drained anything that is the
    whole cost: nothing is opened. Once something HAS been drained the price is
    the bounded tail of `out.jsonl` (`_ECHO_TAIL_BYTES`) plus one file per
    un-echoed follow-up — the same order of work the poll already does over the

    (CLI 2.1.226): `claude-haiku-4-5` streams the real trace, while
    `claude-sonnet-5` streams `{"type": "thinking_delta", "thinking": "",

    "", "signature": "…"}` block — the reasoning is REDACTED, and only its token

    never one of each), so there is no recovering the text where it is redacted:

    """The ordered transcript of a reply: text, thinking and tool segments.

    ONE reader with TWO callers — `_poll` over the live `out.jsonl` and
    `_history` over the persisted session transcript — because they render the
    same conversation, and a second implementation would differ only by
    drifting. The row shapes are near-identical (the API message nests under
    `message` in both); what differs is that only `out.jsonl` carries
    `stream_event` rows. So text arrives as deltas there and as finalized blocks
    in the transcript, and both are read — but never both at once: an
    `assistant` row repeats verbatim the text its deltas already delivered, so
    the finalized blocks are read ONLY when this row set carries no text delta
    at all (the persisted transcript, or a CLI too old for
    `--include-partial-messages`). Decided over the whole list rather than
    per-message on purpose: it makes the choice independent of where the
    `assistant` row sits relative to its own `message_stop`, which is the
    ordering a duplicate would otherwise hinge on.

    THINKING follows the same deltas-or-finalized-blocks rule as text, on its
    own gate: the finalized `thinking` block is read only when no
    `thinking_delta` carried any text. That covers two real cases the text gate
    does not — the persisted transcript (no `stream_event` rows at all, so a
    restored turn's reasoning has nowhere else to come from) and a run whose
    prose streamed while its reasoning did not. A thinking segment that ends up
    with no text is DROPPED rather than returned empty: some models redact the
    trace entirely (see `_thinking_delta_text`), and a "Thought for a moment"
    disclosure that unfolds to nothing is worse than no disclosure.

    Tool calls are read ONLY from finalized `assistant` rows. The streamed
    `content_block_start` for the same call arrives with `input: {}` and its
    arguments only as `input_json_delta` fragments (same reason as
    `_skill_calls`), so the finalized row is both complete and what keeps one
    call from being reported twice.

    Ordering is file order, and a `tool_result` is joined to its `tool_use` by
    `tool_use_id` rather than by position — parallel tools answer out of call
    order routinely, and a result can even be flushed before the message that
    asked for it, hence `orphans`.

    Two segments of the same kind in a row MERGE (the tail grows in place)
    rather than accumulating one segment per delta: the page renders a text
    segment as markdown, and markdown split across arbitrary delta boundaries
    is not the same document.

    **For anything rendering this: segments are the authoritative transcript.**
    Render them whenever the list is non-empty. `text` on the poll payload (and
    on a history turn) is the flat LEGACY field: it is byte-identical to what it
    was before segments existed, and the text segments join back into it exactly
    — but only on a run that carried stream deltas. Where there are none (a CLI
    without `--include-partial-messages`) `text` falls back to the `result` row,
    which is the LAST assistant message only, so it can be a strict subset of
    what the segments say. Rendering `text` when segments exist therefore shows
    less than the turn contained; the reverse never happens. `text` stays the
    right thing to show for the error paths, which produce no segments at all.

    `_send` exists so a message typed mid-turn reaches the CLI's own queue
    instead of spawning a second process. The CLI drains that queue MID-REPLY
    (it echoes the follow-up back through `--replay-user-messages` the moment
    it reads it, finishes the answer it was already giving, then answers the
    new one) and no `result` row separates the echo from the reply it landed
    in — which is exactly why `_read_current_turn` refuses to advance its
    cursor past that echo. The consequence for a reader is that ONE poll
    payload carries two conversational turns with nothing in
    `segments`/`text` to say where the seam is: a user echo row produces no
    segment of its own.

    THE SEAM IS THE `result`, NOT THE ECHO, and that distinction is the whole
    of this function. The echo's file position is where Claude READ the
    message, which is in the middle of the previous answer; the previous
    answer's own `result` row is where that answer ENDS. Splitting at the echo
    puts the first reply's remainder under the follow-up's bubble, which is
    the defect this is fixing, not a fix for it (feedback #9).

    So: an echo with no `result` before it since the window began (or since the
    last seam) records that a follow-up is outstanding, and the NEXT main-turn
    `result` closes the reply it interrupted and becomes a seam. Two follow-ups
    absorbed into one reply leave two outstanding, so the next two `result`
    rows are both seams, in order.

    A reply still streaming with a follow-up outstanding reports NOTHING, and
    that is correct rather than incomplete: nothing has ended yet, so the whole
    payload is still the one reply and belongs in the one bubble.

    Each entry is the `segments` count and the `text` length of everything up
    to and including that `result`, both measured through
    `_segments_from_rows` — the same reader that builds the payload — so they

    """(rows, cursor) — the parsed rows of `out.jsonl` from the last proven-safe
    offset onward, and the offset `_poll` should persist for next time.

    A run used to be one turn, so re-parsing the whole file every ~400ms was
    cheap. Tasks 2-4 made a run a whole SESSION: one `claude` process, many
    turns, one `out.jsonl` that only grows. Re-scanning it in full on every
    poll turned an O(1)-per-tick cost into an O(session length) one: for a
    page (or `claude_spawn.record_session_when_ready`) that has been watching
    a run continuously, ticking every ~400ms, this bounds each read to just
    what changed since the LAST tick — which, steady-state, is one turn's
    worth of rows or less. A page attaching to an already-multi-turn run for
    the first time still pays for a full scan, same as before this existed —
    a one-time cost, not a per-tick one.

    That steady-state narrowing also happens to fix a latent correctness bug,
    not just a perf one: `_poll`'s per-turn state (`text_parts`, `saw_result`,
    …) never reset at a `result` boundary, so a continuously-polled multi-turn
    session used to concatenate every turn's streamed text into one blob
    forever, and could mask a turn that crashed mid-stream because an EARLIER
    turn's `result` row already made `saw_result` true for the whole file.
    Once the cursor has advanced past a turn, later polls simply never see
    its rows again, so that accumulation stops happening — except on the one
    cold-attach read above, whose rows are a real, once-only reflection of
    everything that already happened, not an ongoing leak.

    The cursor only ever advances to the start of the newest row that is
    provably a fresh, user-authored turn — `_starts_new_turn`'s check
    (`_start`/`_send` echoed back by `--replay-user-messages`) AND a `result`
    row closing the previous turn somewhere between `cursor` and it. The
    second half matters because `_send` exists precisely to fold a follow-up
    into a turn still in flight: the CLI echoes that follow-up back in the
    exact same shape, but with no `result` in between, since the turn it is
    joining has not closed. Treating that echo as a fresh turn boundary would
    skip past text the current turn already streamed, so the NEXT poll's
    `rows`/`segments` would shrink instead of only ever growing — the bug this
    half of the rule exists to prevent, mirroring the one below it. A `result`
    alone, even one with more bytes after it, is NOT enough either: a D415
    wake (`system/task_notification`, or its persisted `<task-notification>`
    form) is exactly a `result` followed by more bytes that belong to the
    SAME displayed turn, not a new one — `_segments_from_rows` renders that
    combination as one notice-joined reply, and a page rendering the whole
    `segments` list fresh every poll (see `renderSegments` in template.html)
    needs the ORIGINAL text still in that list on every later poll, not just
    the wake's own continuation. Advancing past a `result` a wake continues
    would make the next poll return only the wake, silently erasing the reply
    already on screen. Everything before the newest genuine turn's own start
    IS provably dead weight for every future poll (this one included, once
    written back), because a real new turn only ever begins once the one
    before it — wakes, absorbed follow-ups and all — is completely finished.

    Reads via binary seek-then-decode, not a text-mode file's `.seek()`, on
    the same reasoning `_scan_transcript` already leans on: the offset being
    seeked to is one *this process* computed and persisted as a byte count,
    and only a binary seek is guaranteed to land exactly there — a text-mode
    file object's `.seek()` argument is an opaque cookie on some platforms,
    not necessarily a raw byte offset, once `errors="replace"` decoding is in

    # was typed. That reply is exactly what the page wants: it is still
    # growing, it is still the newest bubble on screen, and blanking it froze
    # the transcript for the whole window and then dumped the rest of reply A
    # plus the whole of reply B in one burst on the poll where the echo landed
    # (feedback R2-1). So the payload keeps flowing, and the seam between the
    # two replies is REPORTED when it exists (`turn_breaks`) rather than
    # implied by a gap in the stream.
    #
    # The one case that still has to be suppressed is the reason the blanking
    # existed at all: a send made while the run was IDLE. There the window's
    # rows are a turn that already ended — the page has rendered it, settled
    # it, and moved on — and re-emitting them would paint a duplicate of the
    # previous answer into a fresh bubble as if it were the answer to the
    # message just sent. `idle` (computed above off whatever `out.jsonl` ends

    2026-09-18: "what I select as a user stays"). With a `session_id` this reads
    exactly two things, in order:

      1. THE APP'S OWN RECORD (`_session_settings`) — what the last spawn, the
         last send, or the reader's own pill said this chat runs with. Written
         by us, so it is complete and it exists from the instant the chat has an
         id, which is seconds before its first transcript row does.
      2. THAT CHAT'S TRANSCRIPT, and only that one — the legacy fallback, for
         conversations older than the record.

    AND THEN IT STOPS. No sibling transcript, no settings file, nothing about
    the FOLDER. A field neither of the two knows comes back "" and the caller's
    own constant default speaks. That is the whole fix: asking about one
    conversation and being answered partly about another is worse than being
    answered "I don't know", because the caller cannot tell which half it got —
    and it is precisely how a task created with haiku/low opened on fable/max,
    since Claude Code writes the transcript's `effort` key only sometimes and
    the missing half was filled in from whichever neighbour chat ran last.

    WITHOUT a session id — a brand-new chat, which has no conversation to ask —
    the answer is the GLOBAL preference and only that: `model` / `effortLevel`
    in ~/.claude/settings.json, through `_global_defaults` (Akshil, 2026-09-21:
    "only factor in global model/effort for all new chats — from the file
    explorer composer or from the New task modal").

    NOTHING FOLDER-SPECIFIC ANY MORE. This used to walk a ladder — the newest
    five transcripts in the folder's project store, then the folder's
    .claude/settings.local.json, then its .claude/settings.json, and only then
    the global file. Every rung of it made a new chat inherit a decision
    somebody made for something else: one experiment on haiku in a folder
    silently pinned every later chat opened there, and the two folder settings
    files are Claude Code's own config, not a statement about what the reader
    wants THIS window to run. The global pair is the one the reader sets on
    purpose, in the app's own Claude settings page, and it is now the only
    thing a new chat reads — so the composer and the New task card agree, in
    every folder, without either of them guessing.

    `recorded` rides back beside the resolved pair so the composer can rank the
    record ABOVE its own `?model=`/`?effort=` params: those params are a SEED
    for a new chat (the New task card's deep link, "Fix with AI"), and a seed

    when the transcript has none — a preview of "" means a transcript this list
    has no business showing at all.

    The pane rides this read rather than getting one of its own: the first send
    from a pane carries both the app-state block and the words, so the record
    that answers the preview is the record that answers the pane, and a second
    pass would double the opens to learn nothing new. It stops with the preview
    for the same reason — scanning on past it would trade a bounded head read
    for a full one on every pane-less chat.

    Read from the file's HEAD only, and only far enough to find that message:
    the alternative is parsing whole multi-MB transcripts to label a row.

    Two things earn a "": a transcript nobody ever spoke in (a session that
    opened and closed is not a past chat — there is nothing to name it with and
    nothing to resume into), and one whose own `cwd` is not this folder. The
    second is the munge guard: `_munge` maps every non-alphanumeric char to "-",
    so `/a/b-c` and `/a-b/c` land in the SAME project dir, and the directory
    name cannot be decoded back (server/routers/claude_sessions.py carries the
    same caveat and takes the same way out — believe the transcript, not the
    dirname).

    Skipped rows: `isMeta` (the local-command caveat Claude Code writes for the
    user), `isSidechain` (a subagent's prompt, which the user never typed), and
    any row that is machinery all the way down once `_strip_machinery` has had
    it — a slash command's envelope, a subagent reporting back, a wordless
    screenshot send.

    That last test used to be `startswith("<")`, and it was too blunt by exactly
    one case: the case THIS PAGE causes. `composeOutgoing` prepends the app-state
    block and the pane shots to what the user typed, so the only message in a
    session can open with "<" and still be the user's own words — the row went
    nameless while the words sat right there after the block. The annotation
    preamble it never caught at all, having no tag to open with, so those rows
    were titled "The user annotated 1 element in the left previe…".

    module adds nothing but the offer; the store stays strictly READ-ONLY, as it
    must, because it is Claude Code's data and the very edit history the feature
    exists to protect.

    Deliberately NOT the `history` action: that one on this module replays a
    chat SESSION TRANSCRIPT. Two meanings on one action name is the sort of
    collision that is only ever found in production.

    **Files only.** A directory has no checkpoint chain — the store keys on one
    absolute file path (`sha256(abspath)[:16]@vN`) — so a folder target is a
    refusal here as well as being hidden in the page. The gate is the UX, the
    module is the guarantee (MD-11): a hand-written call cannot reach a state
    the panel does not offer.

    TWO cost knobs, both defaulting to the expensive-and-complete answer so a
    hand-written call gets the whole truth, and both declined by the page:

      * `enrich` reads session transcripts (5 MB+) and is what makes the
        creation boundary visible. Honoured here and nowhere else, exactly as
        the annotate panel had it.
      * `deltas` runs `difflib` once per version for the exact added/removed
        pair. It is the entire cost of a timeline — measured at 290 ms of a
        292 ms read on a 453 KB file with 12 checkpoints, against 0.2 ms to
        enumerate the store — and the page declines it because those two numbers
        are row decoration: the diff a user actually reads comes from
        `snapshot_plan`, per version, on the click that opens the row. Nothing
        structural moves either way (`file_history.timeline`), so the list is the
        same list with softer counts.

    ImportError alone is caught, and it means one thing: this folder was copied
    without its `shared/` sibling. A blanket `except Exception` would report a

    Resolved ONLY at the target file's own project dir — with copied files
    the same session id exists in several project dirs with divergent
    content, and a glob would render some other copy's conversation while
    resume continues this one's. Migrates first (same as `start`) so a moved
    file's saved session shows its turns immediately, without waiting for the
    user to send a message.

    Assistant turns carry `segments` as well as `text` — the same ordered
    text/tool record `_poll` returns, through the same `_segments_from_rows`, so
    a restored conversation shows the tool calls it made instead of only the
    prose around them. User turns keep just `text`: there is nothing structured
    about a typed message, and the app-state block is stripped from it BEFORE
    anything else reads it (below), which is also why segments cannot become a
    second route back for the block the user never saw.

    BOTH ROLES carry `uuid`, the transcript record's own id — the first record
    of the reply, for an assistant turn that merged several. On a user turn it is
    what makes `?msg=` resolvable (below); on an assistant turn it is the only
    identity a REPLY keeps across a re-read, and the chat's fold state is
    remembered by it (`ui/Transcript.foldKey`). Without one, a restored reply is
    keyed by its POSITION in the payload, so a history refresh that inserted a
    row moved every fold the reader had set one turn down the log. Omitted — not
    ""ed — on an assistant row with no id, which falls back to the position key
    exactly as before.

    User turns DO carry `uuid`, the transcript record's own id. It is the one
    field a restored turn can be addressed by from outside this page: the Tasks
    list reads the same uuid off the same record (`_prompt`, server/routers/
    tasks.py) and links a message as `?msg=<uuid>`, so the chat can scroll to the
    turn a person clicked instead of to the top of the conversation. "" on a
    record that has none — the template treats the key as optional throughout.

    ...and `ts`, the record's own `timestamp` as epoch seconds, so the chat can
    show WHEN a message was sent (design §C: the time appears in the left icon
    lane on hover). Only on user turns — an assistant reply is dated by the
    message it answers — and the key is ABSENT, not zero, on a row whose
