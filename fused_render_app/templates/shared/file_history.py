"""Read Claude Code's own file-history store, and restore a file from it.

SPEC §34 / DECISIONS D194, D195.

This is the undo the editor templates never had: Claude Code checkpoints a full
copy of every file it is about to change, and that store — not git — is the
authority here. Git answers "what did the last commit say"; this answers "what
did this file look like before the agent touched it", which is the question a
reviewer sitting in the annotate view actually asks, and it has an answer even
in a directory that is not a repository at all.

    <claude-config-dir>/file-history/<sessionId>/<sha256(abspath)[:16]>@v<N>

Each `@vN` is a FULL COPY of the content at a checkpoint, never a diff, and the
filename key is a pure function of the absolute path — so the whole timeline for
one file is enumerable from the filesystem, with no transcript parsing at all.
That is the entire reason this module is cheap enough to call on a view render:
the session transcripts (`<config>/projects/<slug>/<sessionId>.jsonl`) reach
5 MB+, and reading one per render would be a performance trap. They are consulted
only under `enrich=True`, only line-prefiltered, and never allowed to fail
loudly (see `_ghosts`).

Four semantics that are each easy to get wrong, all verified against real
sessions, and each the subject of its own test:

  1. **Versions are checkpoints, not per-edit pre-images.** For roughly half of
     real files the highest `@vN` equals what is on disk; for the other half it
     does not, because the file moved on after the last checkpoint (6 of 13
     matched, 7 did not). So "revert the last change" is NOT "restore the
     highest N".
  2. **...but it is not "the newest version that differs from disk" either, and
     that near-miss is the sharpest lesson in this module.** That rule reads as
     obviously fine and oscillates on the SECOND press: with disk == v3, v3 does
     not differ so the target is v2; once disk == v2, v3 differs and is newest,
     so the target is v3 again — a two-state ping-pong in which v1 is
     unreachable forever. Undo is POSITIONAL: locate where disk sits in the
     chain, then step backwards. See `_locate`.
  3. **A null `backupFileName` means the file did not exist** at that
     checkpoint — Claude created it. Reverting across that boundary is a DELETE,
     not a restore of empty content. The filesystem cannot represent "no
     content", so this fact lives only in the transcript, and it is attributed by
     the record's ABSOLUTE `realParentDir`, never by a path suffix (see
     `_ghost_from` for the cross-project delete that taught us).
  4. **Chains are per-session.** One path edited across several sessions has a
     separate chain under each `<sessionId>/`, and the numbers RESTART: two
     sessions both holding a `@v2` is ordinary. A global timeline therefore
     merges every session dir and orders by TIME (the backup file's mtime),
     never by N.

Strictly READ-ONLY with respect to the Claude config dir. Nothing here writes,
moves or unlinks anything under it, ever — that is the user's live edit history
and this module is a guest in it. The only write it performs is to the target
file itself, via mkstemp + `os.replace` in the target's own directory (the same
atomicity rule the sidecar writers used, D359), gated on `file_writable`.

Stdlib only, and reachable by `sys.path`-relative import rather than
`import fused_render...`, for the reason `appenv.py` next door documents at
length: a template child under the fused engine has NO PYTHONPATH, so the
package import always fails there. Templates adopt this the way annotate.py
adopts appenv — `sys.path.insert` on `../shared` then `import file_history`.

The selector a client hands back is an OPAQUE ID (`"<session>@v<N>"`, or
`"<session>@none<N>"` for a did-not-exist checkpoint) which is matched against
the enumerated timeline and never joined into a path. Traversal has nothing to
traverse: every path this module opens it built itself out of a directory it
listed and a hash it derived.

    A three-part gate, and for the

      * a read-only remote mount is asked about FIRST, because `os.access(W_OK)`
        LIES there — with CacheMode=full the write lands in the local VFS cache
        and only 403s at the async upload (the sidecar-write incident), so
        os.access would wave a doomed write through. Only the shell's persisted
        `read_only` flag knows, and it arrives through `appenv`'s env contract
        (`FUSED_RENDER_RO_MOUNTS`) rather than a `fused_render` import, which a
        template child can never do.
      * an EXISTING file needs W_OK on itself, not merely on its directory: the
        `os.replace` below goes through the directory and would otherwise
        silently blow past a `chmod -w` file.
      * the DIRECTORY needs W_OK either way, because mkstemp and the replace
        both land there. (A half a plain file write does not need and a
        replace does.)

    The two ways the mount probe can be unavailable are handled DIFFERENTLY on
    purpose, and the difference is the whole point of the first bullet. A MISSING
    `appenv` — a copy of this folder taken without its `shared/` sibling —
    degrades to the pure os.access rule, because there is no flag to consult and
    refusing every local file would break the feature outright. But a probe that
    RAISES fails CLOSED: one blanket `except Exception` around the call re-opens
    exactly the incident the probe exists for, letting a malformed
    `FUSED_RENDER_RO_MOUNTS` (or any OSError normalizing a path) fall through to
    the lie, report `ok: True`, and surface the 403 later at an async upload

    Undo is POSITIONAL. The rule this replaced — "the newest version whose
    content differs from disk" — is a near-miss that reads as obviously correct
    and oscillates on the second press:

        disk == v3  ->  v3 differs=False, v2 differs=True  ->  target v2
        disk == v2  ->  v3 differs=True and is newest      ->  target v3

    ...for ever, with v1 unreachable at any point. It answers "which checkpoint
    is most recent and isn't what I have", which is not what undo means.

    So: find where disk SITS in the chain, then step backwards.

      1. position = index of the NEWEST entry whose content equals disk. Newest,
         not oldest: with duplicate content on both sides of a real checkpoint,
         walking from the oldest match would step straight over that checkpoint.
      2. target = the first entry OLDER than position (a higher index) that still
         DIFFERS from disk. The differs-check stays inside the walk — it is
         deliberately not "the entry at position+1" — because identical adjacent
         versions are common and restoring one would write the same bytes back,
         an action that looks like a broken button.
      3. position == -1 (disk is in no checkpoint at all — the `unique_current`
         case, derived from this same index so the two can never disagree) means
         the first step back is "discard to the most recent checkpoint":
         target = entry 0.
      4. no such older entry => at_earliest. A distinct terminal state that
         DISABLES the button, rather than falling back to something newer —
         falling back is precisely what made the old rule a two-state toggle.

    Consequence, and it is intended: the chain is walked in one direction only.
    "Redo" needs no new UI, because the timeline already lets the user click a
    newer row explicitly — and that asymmetry is right for a button labelled

    skip whose own time is unknown. Older skips are harmless WHEN THERE IS A
    TARGET — one unreadable ancient checkpoint must not cost the user their undo.

    When there is NO target the floor is `-inf`, so every skip counts, and that

    `unique_current` is the sharp one, and it is the same index that drives case
    3 of the walk: current on-disk content is in NO checkpoint, so a restore
    destroys the only copy. When it is True the UI must not let the write land
    without an explicit confirmation showing the loss — and `annotate.py`
    additionally refuses the write unless that confirmation is echoed back.

    `diff` carries the change itself (see `_diff`), because the aggregates beside
    it answer how MUCH changes and never WHAT — different questions, and on the
    one destructive action in this view the second is the one being confirmed. It
    rides on the plan rather than on an action of its own precisely because of the
    freshness rule above: a diff computed by a separate call is a diff of a second
    scan, and the whole point of echoing this plan's `id` back is that the thing
    confirmed and the thing applied are one state of the disk.

    Every "nothing to revert to" answer is returned as data (`ok: False` +
    `error`, with `at_earliest` distinguishing the terminal state from an empty
    store), never raised: they are ordinary states of a file, not failures.

    Refuses rather than degrades, because every refusal here is a case where
    guessing destroys something:

      * an unresolvable selector, or a target the store has never recorded a
        version of — the only path guard a module that cannot see the view can
        offer. A crafted `file` param therefore reaches nothing Claude never
        edited;
      * a directory target;
      * a SYMLINK target. `os.replace` swaps the LINK for a regular file rather
        than writing through it, so the real file kept its pre-revert content
        while the call reported success — and the then-extant sidecar stash captured a file
        that was never overwritten. Refusing is chosen over `realpath`-ing first,
        deliberately: the store's key is the sha256 of the path the VIEW opened,
        so following the link would revert a path whose own timeline is a
        different chain, and silently editing a file the user did not name is
        worse than declining to.
      * an unwritable target (`file_writable`, which includes the read-only
        mount that `os.access` lies about).

    Like `revert_plan`, this takes no `enrich` parameter — the selector must mean
    the same thing to the plan and to the write.

    The write is mkstemp + `os.replace` in the target's OWN directory — atomic,
    never cross-device, and no reader ever sees a half-written file. The mode of
    an existing file is carried onto the replacement, since a fresh mkstemp is
    0600 and a revert has no business changing a file's permissions.
