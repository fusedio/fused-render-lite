"""Is a Claude Code session mid-turn RIGHT NOW — read off its transcript.

One question, asked from three places that had no way to share it:

* the sessions router (`server/routers/claude_sessions.py`) paints a `running`
  badge in the Inbox and the Board,
* the Tasks router (`server/routers/tasks.py`) uses the same answer to decide
  whether a thread's newest message still has a turn open,
* **the scheduler** (`fused_render/schedule.py`) must not resume a conversation
  the user is typing into, because two `claude --resume S` processes append to
  one transcript and the transcript is the session.

The third one is why this module exists rather than the rule staying where it
was. `schedule.py` may not import anything under `fused_render.server` — the
router imports the schedule, and `server/__init__` -> `app.py` -> routers would
close the loop. The other way out was to duplicate the rule locally, the way
`claude_artifacts.py` duplicates `CLAUDE_DIR`; that is right for a two-line
constant and wrong here, because the rule is not a constant. It is a tail read,
a housekeeping-record filter, a turn_duration special case and two windows, and
a scheduler that disagreed with the badge by even one of those would defer a
message the page says is safe (or, worse, send one it says is not). One copy,
one answer.

**The rule, stated once.** A transcript's mtime alone lies: Claude Code appends
housekeeping records (away summaries, turn timing, last-prompt) after the turn
is over, so a file touched two seconds ago may belong to a session that has been
idle for an hour. So the last 16KB is read and walked BACKWARDS to the newest
record that is not housekeeping; that record's timestamp is the activity. A
`turn_duration` record newer than any real message is the explicit "the turn
just ended" marker and reports 0.0, which no window can make live. Activity
inside 45 seconds is running. A file nothing has touched in 90 seconds skips
the read entirely — it is stale either way, and the read would only be deciding
what kind of stale.

Nothing here raises. An unreadable transcript, a vanished file, a truncated
line: every one of them answers "not running", because the two callers that
matter both degrade the same way — a badge that stays dark, and a scheduled
message that goes rather than waits for a turn nobody can see.

    A second rule, deliberately, and the difference is the question. The 45s
    window above answers "has this session been active recently", which is the
    right shape for a BADGE in a list of sessions: it is a summary, a little
    lag rounds off invisibly, and the cost of being late is nothing.
    `transcript_turn_open` answers "is a reply being written into this file
    while I watch", for a chat that has the conversation OPEN and is showing a
    shimmering working line under it. There a window is not lag, it is a lie
    told for its whole length — measured with the app's own chat (Akshil,
    2026-08-21, a `claude --resume` driven from a terminal): the reply landed
    and the line kept shimmering for the balance of the 45 seconds, because a
    non-interactive run writes no `turn_duration` record for `tail_activity` to
    find and nothing else says the turn ended.

    So this reads the last MESSAGE instead of the clock. Walking the tail back
    to the newest `user`/`assistant` row:

    * an **assistant** row with no `tool_use` block is a reply that finished —
      the transcript's version of `_poll`'s `result`, and the same test that
      makes `done` per-turn there,
    * an **assistant** row carrying `tool_use`, or a **user** row (a prompt, or
      a `tool_result` being fed back), is a turn still in flight,
    * EXCEPT the CLI's own interrupt marker ("[Request interrupted by user]",
      a `user` row the stop button leaves as the last word): that is a turn
      that ENDED, and a slash command's envelope rows are housekeeping to skip
      (`_turn_open_by_user_row`) — both only when `interrupt_closes` is True,
    * no message at all in the tail is not evidence of one running.

    `now` still matters for exactly one thing: a turn that was OPEN when its
    process died stays open in the file forever — a terminal closed mid-reply
    leaves a user row as the last word. `STALE_TAIL_SEC` is the ceiling on how
    long that lie may stand, and it is the same ceiling the window rule uses.
