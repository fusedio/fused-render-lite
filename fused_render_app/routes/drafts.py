"""Drafts over HTTP — the composer's unsent text, and the New task modal's
half-filled form.

The model is `fused_render/drafts.py`; this is the HTTP skin over it, and it is
deliberately thin. Every rule about what a draft is — empty is a delete, an
unknown field is dropped, a key is one of two shapes — lives in the store,
because the badge join in `routers/tasks.py` and the schedule router's
delete-on-create read the same store and must not be able to disagree with this
file about any of them.

**No D3 write guard**, unlike `POST /api/schedule`. That guard is on the two
endpoints that start and stop an unattended agent turn; a draft executes
nothing, and the POSTs in `routers/tasks.py` (read, archive, delete) are
unguarded for the same reason — this is the same weight of change as marking a
message read.

**Every mutation announces itself** (`tasks_watch.notify`). A draft is a listed
fact now: a chat draft puts a `✎ Draft` chip on its session's row, and a task
draft IS a row. Both have to appear and vanish without a reload, and the
long-poll in `/api/tasks/changes` is how every other change to a row already
travels. The key announced is the key the listing files the row under — the
session id for a chat draft, `draft:<id>` for a task draft — so the changes
endpoint rebuilds exactly that row and nothing else.

TWO keys when a task draft is bound to a session, because then two things
change and only one of them is a row. A session-bound draft is never a row of
its own (`routers/tasks.py::_draft_rows` skips it outright); the session's own
row carries it instead, as `bound_draft` and the `✎ Draft` chip (`_bound_chips`,
joined in `_row`). So the draft's key is announced so a page holding a stale
row under it — from before the binding, or from an older build — is told to
drop it (the changes endpoint reports it `gone`, having no row to rebuild), and
the session's key is announced because that is the row whose chip just
appeared, changed, or went. Nothing "swaps back" on a discard — the session's
row was never touched, so there is nothing to reverse; it simply repaints
without the chip.

BOTH CHAT ROUTES ANNOUNCE THE SAME TWO KEYS when the session they name has a
bound form, and for the same reason: the composer is a second door onto that one
record ("one record, two doors", `drafts.chat_view`), so a write or a delete
through this door is a write to the form the other door shows. Which form that
is, is read before the write (`drafts.bound_chat_draft`) — emptying the box
deletes it, and afterwards nothing can name it.

`new:<file>` announces itself too, as of round 2. It used to be the one key
that did not — no session meant no task row meant nothing for a listening page
to repaint — but an unsent chat IS a row now, filed under the folder it was
opened on (`routers/tasks.py::_new_chat_draft_row`), so it has to appear and
vanish live like every other (design.md, "Round 2"; Akshil, 2026-09-11).

**Moving that key onto a session is not a route here**, and the missing
endpoint is deliberate. A chat's first send is what creates the session, and no
page can prove which session id its own send made — every client-side version
of that inference had a gap (Bugbot, PR #1118, 2026-09-12). What the send does
say is which draft it is SPENDING: it tags its own run with the key
(`draft_key`, written into the run's `meta.json` by `agent._start`), and the
server moves the number when that run's session id appears, at listing time:
`routers/tasks.py::_settle_new_chats` — but ONLY once the record itself is
gone. A send writes nothing here at all (`ui/Composer.tsx`: "a send just
sends"), so a `new:<file>` draft, which exists only because the reader asked
for one, goes away the one ordinary way anything here does: a DELETE through
this door.

Routes take `{key:path}` rather than `{key}` for one reason: a `new:<file>` key
carries a file path, separators and all, and a plain path parameter stops at
the first one.
