"""GET /api/claude-artifacts — every Artifact published from this machine's
Claude Code sessions, for the Explorer homepage's artifacts index.

A publish leaves no index behind, only a `frame-link` record inside the session
transcript it happened in, so the listing is recovered by scanning
~/.claude/projects/<encoded-cwd>/*.jsonl and joining those records to the
Artifact tool calls that carry the author's description and favicon. All of that
— the scan, the dedupe by hosted url across sessions, and what one listed
artifact IS — lives in `fused_render/claude_artifacts.py` rather than in this
handler, for the same reason the apps walk lives in `app_listing.py`: those are
the rules worth testing and reusing directly, and a route is not the place for
them.

Read-only and unguarded, like the neighbouring /api/claude-sessions: it reads
transcripts and touches nothing.
