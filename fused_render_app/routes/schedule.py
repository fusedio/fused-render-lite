"""Scheduled Claude messages: list, schedule, cancel.

The model — the store, the firing decision, the catch-up bound — is
`fused_render/schedule.py`; this is the HTTP skin over it. Two things live here
rather than there, both because they need what only this layer knows:

* **the mount refusal.** A scheduled turn is an agent turned loose on a path,
  and the bytes under the mounts dir come from a remote over FUSE. Every peer
  gate refuses those paths (the claude template's own `condition.py` exists for
  this single refusal), so scheduling a message against one would route around
  that gate. The mounts registry lives above the schedule module, so the check
  belongs on this side of the import.
* **ValueError -> 400.** The model raises with a message written for a human;
  the route is what turns that into a status code.

Reads are unguarded like every other read endpoint. Both POSTs carry the D3
X-Fused guard: one of them schedules code execution, and the other stops it.

    ONE copy of the forwarding list, because there are now two endpoints that
    create an entry from a request body — the New task form here, and the chat
    admission next door (`POST /api/tasks/queue/admit`), which stores the very
    message a user just typed when its folder is busy. A queued chat send that
    silently dropped `model`, `effort` or the attachments would be a different
    message from the one that would have gone had the folder been free, which is
    the one thing the queue must never be: it delays work, it does not change it.

    `title`, `description`, `new_task_each_run`, `session_learned`, `immediate`,
    `images` and `attachments` are passed straight through and normalised by the
    model (`_text`/`_flag`/`_images`/`_attachments`), not validated here — the
    form omits a field rather than sending a blank one, so "absent", "null" and
    "" all have to mean the same thing, and this layer must not hold a second
    copy of the model's rules. What it must not do is DROP them; a body-dict
    endpoint silently ignores what it does not name, which is how they went
    missing in the first place.

    `follow_of` is forwarded the same way and validated by the model, which is
    the only layer that can: it names an entry in the scheduler's store, so
    "does this exist" is a question only that store answers. The admission
    endpoint is its one sender — a message typed into a chat whose first message
    is still queued has no session id to pass, and this is what keeps the two
    of them one task.

    `origin` is the one field here that is NOT taken from the body, and that is
    the whole of it: it says which surface asked for this message, and a request
    cannot be trusted to say. The chat admission passes `"chat"` because it IS
    the chat's send path; the New task form and the calendar pass nothing, and
    their entries carry none — which is what lets a chat tell a message it
    queued itself from one somebody scheduled into it (`schedule.create`).

    `model` and `effort` are likewise not validated into a 400: `--model` takes
    an alias or a full id and `--effort` one of five levels, and the authority on
    both is the CLI this server shells out to, not a list in this file that would
    go stale the day Claude Code learns a new one. A value the CLI refuses fails
    the RUN, with the CLI's own sentence on the entry, which is a better error
    than a 400 written from a guess.

    and the record goes. True if the record was there to drop.

    THE NUMBER SURVIVES THE DRAFT, exactly as it survives an edit (`replaces`)
    and as a pending row's survives its first run. A draft is listed under
    `draft:<id>` with a TASK number of its own (round 2 of design.md), and
    scheduling it is the same event for that row that a first run is for a
    `pending:` one: the thing keeps going, under a new key. Without this the
    user would watch the TASK-118 they had been typing into become TASK-119 the
    moment they pressed Schedule — the renumber `replaces` exists to prevent,
    one stage earlier (Akshil, 2026-09-11).

    Rekey BEFORE the delete, and in that order for a reason: `rekey` reads
    `task_ids.json`, not the draft store, so the order does not actually matter
    to it — but a failure between the two must leave the draft, which is
    recoverable, rather than a numberless task, which is not.

    NOT FOR A DRAFT THAT BELONGS TO A SESSION (Akshil, 2026-09-12). Such a
    draft never had a number of its own — the listing skips it precisely
    because the session it is bound to holds the task's number already
    (`routers/tasks.py::_draft_numbers`) — and this message is landing IN that
    session, which is where the number stays. Moving anything onto
    `pending:<entry-id>` here would be inventing a second identity for a task
    that has one; the entry naming a session is the whole test, since that is
    the key the listing will file it under (`_collect`).

    TWO DOORS, ONE FUNCTION. The New task modal hands over `draft_id` when it
    schedules (`api_schedule_create`), and the composer's session-less send
    hands the same draft over as a KEY — `draft:<id>` in `draft_key` — when that
    send is queued instead of run (`spend_chat_draft`, `POST
    /api/tasks/queue/admit`). Those are one event said on two surfaces, and two
    copies of "carry the number, then drop the record" is the kind of pair that
    drifts on the first fix applied to one of them.

    Best-effort and silent, like every other clean-up on this road: the message
    IS scheduled, and a read-only state dir must not turn that into a 500. A
    draft that could not be dropped costs one stale row, never the task. An

    message became, and the record goes. True if anything moved.

    Takes either shape the composer can be holding: a chat key (`new:<file>`,
    or a session id once the conversation exists) or a TASK draft's listing key
    (`draft:<id>`), which is handed straight to `spend_task_draft` — the same
    move `POST /api/schedule` makes for a `draft_id`.

    THE SAME TWO MOVES `api_schedule_create` MAKES FOR A FORM, one surface over.
    A New task card that is scheduled hands over its `draft_id`, and the number
    the draft row was wearing is rekeyed onto `pending:<entry-id>` before the
    record is dropped, so the TASK-118 somebody has been typing into is the
    TASK-118 they end up with. A chat whose send is QUEUED is that same event —
    the words in the composer have just become a booked message — and until this
    it made neither move: the `new:<file>` draft kept the number it was
    allocated at the first keystroke, `_task_number` minted a SECOND one for
    `pending:<entry-id>`, and the reader watched TASK-057 become TASK-058 on the
    send that queued it. The abandoned key then sat in `task_ids.json` for ever,
    which also left `_settle_new_chats` scanning the runs tree on every listing
    for a draft nothing would ever settle (review, PR #1124).

    THE NUMBER ONLY MOVES OFF A `new:<file>` KEY, which is the schedule form's
    own rule read through the other door: a chat that HAS a session is numbered
    under that session, and this message is landing in it, so there is nothing to
    carry forward and only the record goes. Moving anything onto
    `pending:<entry-id>` there would invent a second identity for a task that
    already has one.

    THE RECORD GOES ONLY IF IT STILL HOLDS THE WORDS THAT WERE SENT. The key is
    the still-open composer's own, and a follow-up typed while the first send
    was being admitted (the notes capture and the tray copy run first) can
    autosave under it before this runs — deleting then would lose that
    follow-up from the store while the box still showed it, so a reload dropped
    it (Bugbot, 1d50d4303). With `sent` given, a record whose text differs from
    the message that queued is left alone; the number still moves, since it is
    the entry's now either way. Without `sent` (a form draft's road) the record
    goes as before.

    ONE IMPLEMENTATION, TWO DOORS (merge of PR #1124 into
    design-drafts-one-record, 2026-09-17). `api_schedule_create` spends the chat
    draft a scheduled message was written in (`draft_key`) and the queue admit
    spends the one a queued send came out of, and those are the same event said
    twice — so they are the same function, and the guards below are the union of
    what each had. The form's road passes no `sent` (the create IS the spend, and
    there is no later keystroke to protect) and the queue's passes the message it
    admitted.

    Best-effort like every other draft write on this road, and for the same
    reason: the message IS queued, and a read-only state dir must not turn that
    into a 500. A draft that could not be dropped costs one stale row, never the
    task. `""` — an absent or malformed key, which is what every client written
    before the queue sends — does nothing at all.

    # opens edits the chat record the words were typed in, under that record's
    # own key (`new:<file>` before the conversation exists, the session id
    # after). So the draft this create is spending may be a CHAT draft, and the
    # two moves it needs are the two `draft_id` already makes — carry the TASK
    # number forward, then drop the record — for exactly the same reasons:
    # without the rekey the reader watches the TASK-118 they were typing into
    # become TASK-119 the moment they press Schedule, and without the delete the
    # task they just booked is listed twice.
    #
    # NOT FOR A KEY THAT NAMES A SESSION, on the same guard `draft_id` takes: a
    # chat draft on a real session borrows that conversation's number
    # (`_draft_numbers` mints none for it), and this message is landing IN that
    # conversation, which is where the number stays. Only `new:<file>` — the
    # shape that IS a row with a number of its own — has anything to move.
    #
    # Best-effort and optional like every other clean-up here: the message IS
    # scheduled, and a draft that could not be dropped costs one stale row.
    #
    # THROUGH `spend_chat_draft`, WHICH IS THAT PARAGRAPH AS A FUNCTION. The
    # queue admit (`routers/tasks.py`) spends a chat draft on exactly the same
    # terms one door over — a queued send is this create said from the composer
    # — and two copies of "carry the number, then drop both halves of the
    # record" is the kind of pair that drifts on the first fix applied to one of
    # them. No `sent` here: the create IS the spend, so there is no later
    # keystroke in that box to protect (merge, 2026-09-17).
    # HANDED OVER RAW, because `draft_key` has three shapes and only two of them
    # are chat keys: a `draft:<id>` is a TASK draft (a composer sending out of a
    # form it never finished) and `drafts.chat_key` refuses it. `spend_chat_draft`
    # is the one place that tells them apart; normalising here first is what made
    # that third shape a silent no-op. `chat_draft` below is still the CHAT
    # reading of the key, and only for the "not twice" test.

    # just consumed it. Same request as the create for the same reason the
    # `draft_id` delete is, and best-effort for the same one (Akshil,
    # 2026-09-11).

def api_schedule_queue():
    """What is past due and waiting, and what is mid-flight.

    A separate endpoint from the listing rather than a field on it, and for the
    reason that shapes both: the listing is the whole schedule (everything ever
    created, with a recurrence projection computed per template), while this is
    the handful of rows the queue popover draws on app open. Folding it in would
    make a poll for "is anything waiting?" pay for the page's payload; splitting
    it out also lets the popover ask again after a cancel without redrawing the
    calendar.

    Unguarded like the other reads, and side-effect-free on purpose — the tick
    owns every state change, so opening the popover cannot change what runs.

    **`live` is the third list**, added for the queue dock (Akshil, 2026-08-17):
    the entries whose TURN is still going. `schedule.queue()` deliberately stops
    at `sending` — a spawned run has its own cancel in the job registry — but the
    registry's row knows only a title and a status line, so a run parked on a
    permission prompt was visible and still unreachable: nothing on screen said
    where to go and answer it. These entries carry the target and the session the
    turn landed in, which is exactly what an "Open in Explorer" link needs, and
    the dock joins them onto its job rows by id (`sys:schedule:<entry id>`).

    Live is `sent` with an EMPTY `turn` — the same rule the client's `isLive`
    applies, and it is a rule about the pair: `state` says the message was sent,
    `turn` is written once when the turn ends, so an unwritten turn is one still
    in flight. Typically nought to two rows; a historical `sent` entry has a turn
    and does not appear."""

    here, and more obviously than most: this one starts an unattended agent turn
    on the spot, which is the exact thing D3's header guard keeps a foreign page
    from doing.

    **It does not move `due`.** The schedule time is a fact about what was asked
    for, so the row reads as having run early rather than as having been
    scheduled for now — see `schedule.run_now`, which is where every rule about
    this lives. This layer only maps the model's honest refusal onto a status
    code: 404 when there is no such entry, 409 when there is one and it cannot
    run (already sent, already sending, cancelled, or its conversation is
    mid-turn). Both carry the model's sentence, because "it didn't run" without
    a reason is what makes a dragged card feel broken.

    **QUEUED IS NOT A REFUSAL, and it is a 200.** With the project queue on
    (`project_queue`), a folder another task is holding does not refuse this
    message — it HOLDS it: the entry stays pending, gains `priority` (asking for
    something now IS a skip, and skipping is what run-now means once the folder
    is busy), and the row reads `queued` at position 1. Nothing went wrong and
    nothing was lost, so an error status would be a lie the client then has to
    undo — the dragged card would snap back over work that is going out the
    moment the folder frees. The answer carries `ok: false` with a `reason` of
    `"queued"` and the name of the task in front, which is the sentence the card
    prints.

    Naming who is ahead is a TASKS fact — the numbering and the title
    precedence — so it is asked of the tasks router (`queue_ahead_of`), which
    owns both. Imported inside the function: the two routers are siblings and a
    module-level import in this direction is a cycle waiting for the first person
    to add one in the other.

    **AND SO IS THE POSITION.** The model counts a folder's line in ENTRIES
    (`schedule._queue_position`); the Tasks page counts it in TASKS — one slot
    each, however many messages a task has queued — and that is the number on
    the row, in the chip and in "#2 in line". Two numbers for one line is one
    number wrong, so the page's is taken here too (`tasks._queue_place`, the
    same derivation the admit and skip verbs answer with) and the model's is
    kept only as the fallback for a task the listing does not place. Both are
    read off ONE collection, because they are two facts about one set of tasks.

    Naming it carries the LINK as well as the words — `ahead_session` and
    `ahead_target`, `tasks-lib.taskHref`'s own pair — so the card that says
    "behind TASK-041" can be clicked through to the conversation in front. Both
    "" for a holder that has no session yet, which is the case the sentence
    below is about.

    The holder is named by its TASK key (`ahead_task_key`) rather than by its
    session: an entry the scheduler has claimed but not yet spawned has no
    session at all, and it is `pending:<id>` — a real row, with a real number —
