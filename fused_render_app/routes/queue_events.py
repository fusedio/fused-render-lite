"""POST /api/tasks/queue/event — the project queue's ear on its own processes.

The queue moves on EVENTS, never on a poll (design.md, "No polls in queue
logic"). Three of those events are only ever known inside a process the server
spawned and does not otherwise talk to:

* `turn_ended` — the CLI wrote a `result` row, so the turn that owned this
  folder is over. Seen by `session_host.py`, which is already tailing
  `out.jsonl` every tick for its own reap timer.
* `exited`     — the CLI process is gone (its own exit, or the host's idle
  reap). Seen by the same loop, on its way out.
* `card_raised` — a permission card was parked, so the task is waiting on a
  human and is no longer the one *running*. Seen by `permission_server.py` the
  instant it writes the request file, long before the page polls it.
* `card_cleared` — that card has an answer, so the task is a running task
  again. Seen by the same process, which is the ONLY one that sees every
  answer: a card can be decided from the page, from the terminal, or by a file
  dropped beside the request, and all three end as the `.res.json` this server
  is already blocked on.

Those two modules are TEMPLATES: stdlib only, no `fused_render` import (SPEC
PY-15), spawned as separate processes. HTTP is the only wire they have back
here, hence this endpoint rather than a function call.

The posts are unconditional and this endpoint is the flag gate for the QUEUE:
with `project_queue_enabled` off it answers `{"ok": true, "ignored": true}` and
the manager is never even built, so the flag-off queue behaviour is
byte-for-byte what shipped in main plus one ignored request. It also never
500s on a manager error — the caller is a fire-and-forget daemon thread that
cannot act on a failure, and a traceback in the log is worth more than a
status code nobody reads.

ONE THING IS NOT GATED (Akshil, 2026-09-17): `turn_ended`/`exited` also tell
`tasks_watch.mark_turn_ended` a turn just ended, and that call happens BEFORE
the flag check above. It is a SYNC fix for the Tasks listing, not a queue
feature — the same handoff lag (a finished task's row still reading
`in_progress` for up to a couple of seconds after its folder changed hands)
exists whether or not one-task-per-folder is switched on, because it comes
from the registry row and the transcript tail lagging the session host's own
event, not from the queue. The manager dispatch below stays exactly as
flag-gated as ever.

The body's `at` (bugbot, 2026-09-17) is WHEN THE HOST SAW THE TURN END, not
when this HTTP request happened to be handled — a slow request must not read
as a LATE turn to `mark_turn_ended`'s ordering, or an overlapping follow-up's
own, earlier-arriving mark gets clobbered by an event that is actually older
than it. Forwarded through unchanged; a missing or unparseable one falls back
to server-now, same as before this existed.
