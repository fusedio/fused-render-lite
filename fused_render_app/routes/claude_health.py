"""GET /api/claude/health — is Claude Code usable on this machine.

Its own endpoint rather than a field on /api/config, deliberately: /api/config is
read on every page load and by the status-banner poll, and the facts here are
backed by process spawns behind a disk cache. Bolting them onto that payload
would put a version probe on the hot path to pay for a strip that only renders
while something is wrong.

It is also NOT `/api/claude-config/status`, which stays what it is: one
`isdir(~/.claude)` answering "is there config to edit". That was always an honest
gate for the Preferences tab and was never a claim about whether Claude Code
works — this endpoint is that claim.
