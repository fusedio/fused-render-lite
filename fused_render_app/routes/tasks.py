"""Tasks — one row per Claude Code session, with its thread of messages.

A **task is a session**, 1:1, and a thread is the messages that entered it —
from the explorer's Claude chat, from the template chat, or from a schedule. The
thread does not care which; that is the whole point of collapsing the two stores
the app used to keep side by side (the scheduled-message list it owns, and the
session transcripts Claude Code owns, joined by one field).

The endpoints, and the split between the first three is the design constraint
this file is written around:

* ``GET /api/tasks`` — every task, newest first, each carrying its **three most
  recent** messages. This runs for every row on the page and is polled, so
  nothing in it may scale with transcript size. Transcripts are append-only, so
  the scan below reads each file **once** and thereafter only the bytes that
  were appended since — a multi-MB transcript is never re-read. One field on the
  row is deliberately NOT read from that window: `next_run` (with the entry it
  names) is `min(at)` over every pending entry, because the Board orders Upcoming
  by it and three messages cannot answer it. See `_next_run`.
* ``GET /api/tasks/pulse`` — the same task states reduced to the four fields the
  global sidebar needs. It deliberately carries no titles, paths, descriptions,
  or message bodies; Home should not download the Tasks page just to draw its
  status dot and unread count.
* ``GET /api/tasks/{key}/messages`` — one task's FULL thread. This is the
  "Show more" click: a whole-transcript parse, which is affordable exactly
  because it happens for one task at a time and never for a listing.
* ``GET /api/tasks/scheduled?from&to`` — every SCHEDULED message in a window,
  for the calendar. Separate from the listing rather than a window parameter on
  it, because the listing's three-message tail is right for an accordion and
  wrong for a time axis, and one field cannot mean both.
* ``POST /api/tasks/read`` — mark one message read, or (``all: true``) every
  message in one task, in one request and one store write.
* ``POST /api/tasks/archive`` — file one task away. ONE gesture with two halves
  (cancel the work, archive the session), which is why it is a verb here rather
  than a triage write the client composes. See the archiving section at the end.
* ``POST /api/tasks/unarchive`` — take that filing back, and nothing else: the
  work archiving cancelled stays cancelled, no run starts, and the task lands in
  whatever lane it DERIVES into rather than one a caller names. Same section.
* ``POST /api/tasks/delete`` — take the ROW away for good: cancel the pending
  work exactly as archive does, then tombstone the key so no listing shows it.
  The transcript is not touched (D306) and new activity in the conversation
  revives the row rather than running invisibly. Same section.
* ``POST /api/tasks/erase`` — the same, and then the SESSION itself: the
  transcript, its subagent sidecars, and every record this app keeps about it.
  Nothing survives to revive, which is the whole difference from delete (D307).
  Same section.

**Drafts ride on this listing** (fused_render/drafts.py, routers/drafts.py).
Two joins, no new list endpoint: every session row gains `draft` — the one-line
preview of whatever is sitting unsent in that conversation's composer, or None
— and every TASK draft is emitted as a row of its own (`kind:"draft"`,
`state:"draft"`, key `draft:<id>`, no number). Both travel down
`/api/tasks/changes` like any other change to a row, which is what makes the
`✎ Draft` chip appear and a new draft land in Upcoming without a reload. Both
are absent from the pulse, deliberately — see `api_tasks_pulse`.

A task draft that names a `session_id` is the exception to all of that: it is
the next message of a conversation that already has a row and a number, so it
is NOT A ROW AT ALL. No draft row is emitted for it and no number is minted
(`_draft_rows`, `_draft_numbers`); the session's own row stands exactly as it
always did — same title, same lane, same number, same click into the chat — and
merely gains two fields: `bound_draft`, the form's id, and `draft`, its preview,
so the row wears the red `✎ Draft` chip like any other unsent words
(`_bound_chips`). Nothing is hidden anywhere, which is the point: a stand-in row
was a second thing to read, it took the conversation off the Cards wall (a wall
of transcripts, which a form has none of), and it made one session row open a
modal where every other opens the chat (bugbot, PR #1126; Akshil, 2026-09-12).
The way back into the form is the composer's Schedule hop, which reopens the
draft already bound to that session instead of minting another.

**What a message is.** A user prompt in the transcript, or a scheduled entry.
Those two overlap: a scheduled message that fired IS a prompt in the transcript
(`_send` hands `entry["message"]` over verbatim), so listing both would show it
twice. The full thread therefore JOINS them on the message body, nearest in
time, and the listing — which cannot afford to look at every prompt — counts the
same thing arithmetically: the transcript's prompts, plus the scheduled entries
that never reached a transcript at all (pending, missed, cancelled). Message ids
follow from that count and nothing else: the Nth message in time order is MSG-N
(`tasks_store.message_ids`), so nothing has to be stored and nothing can drift.

**When a task stops being one.** A task with no session whose every scheduled
message has reached a terminal state that never ran — cancelled, skipped, missed
— is not a task any more and is not listed anywhere (`_is_task`). Deleting a
message that never ran leaves no session, no transcript and no history, so there
is nothing for a row to be about; leaving one behind meant an empty shell sitting
in Archive forever. A task that HAS run keeps its row whatever happens to its
entries, because it has a transcript and this app does not destroy transcripts
(D306) — Archive is the honest resting place for that one. This is decided in
`_collect`, which every endpoint below reads, so the listing, the board and the
calendar agree by construction rather than each learning the rule; it is not a
filter, and the default filters are unchanged.

**A task key** is the session id, or `pending:<entry-id>` for a message that
names no session at all and so has none to be filed under yet (§5). A message
that DOES name one — a re-send, a message scheduled out of an open chat — is
that session's task from the moment it is created, even before it runs; see
`_entry_session`. The number a pending row is showing follows it onto the
session id at the first run — see `tasks_store.rekey` — so the row the user has
been watching does not silently renumber the moment it finally runs.

Every field degrades rather than fails. An unreadable transcript, a truncated
line, a session whose cwd is gone, a store that is not there yet — each costs
that one task, or that one fact about it, and never the listing. That is the
posture of every module this one reads from (claude_sessions.py,
claude_artifacts.py, schedule.py) and it is the posture here.

Reads are unguarded, like every other read endpoint. The one write marks a
message read (or a whole task's worth of them, which is the same write with a
wider object) — the same weight of change as `POST /api/claude-sessions/triage`
next door, which carries no guard either: it moves a badge, it does not run
code.

# A task's status, decided HERE and read by every view. `upcoming` and `blocked`
# are the two triage does not have a word for — a session cannot be "not yet",
# and the Inbox's three columns have no place to put a run that stopped — which
# is why the union below is not symmetric.
#
# `blocked` is a STATUS and not only the `failed` boolean beside it, because a
# run that broke is not a kind of done. It used to be exactly that: `done` with
# a flag, so every view had to remember to read the flag and paint it, and any
# view that did not simply lost the news. One decision, made once, on the
# server.
#
# THE LANE IS CALLED `blocked` AND NOT `failed` (Akshil, 2026-09-03: "failed
# status could be renamed as blocked … for fail retry, for block a reason"). The
# word names what the reader has to do about it rather than what happened: a run
# that broke and a run parked on a card nobody answered are the same fact from
# the outside — this task is not moving until a person does something — and one
# lane holding both is what stops a parked run being read as work in flight. The
# `failed` boolean is untouched and still says which of the two it was; it is
# what paints the ring red and what `blocked_reason` reports as "failed".
#
# `needs_attention` is the one status above In Progress: the run IS in flight,
# and it is in flight in the one way that will never end on its own. It is a
# status rather than a flag for the same reason `blocked` is — a view that has
# to remember to read a flag is a view that will one day not, and this is the
# fact the whole feature exists to carry.
#
# `queued` is a STATUS and not a flag beside `upcoming`, for the reason `blocked`
# gives and one more of its own. The reason it shares: a lane the reader has to
# assemble from a boolean is a lane some view will one day forget to assemble,
# and this one has three surfaces (List chip, Board lane, chat bubble) that must
# agree about one task. The reason that is its own: a queued task is NOT upcoming
# — its message is due, it would be running this second, and the only thing
# between it and a process is another task holding the same folder
# (`project_queue`). "Upcoming" is a promise about the clock; this is a fact
# about the machine, and merging them would put work that is late into a lane
# the reader scans for work that is early. It sits between `upcoming` and
# `in_progress` because that is where it sits in time: asked for, not yet
# running. It only ever appears with the project queue flag on
# (`project_queue.enabled`); with the flag off nothing derives it.

# behind the task draft bound to it and narrowed to the settled statuses so a

    run finished and whose next occurrence is already on the books has unread
    OUTPUT sitting in it, and filing it under Upcoming because the newest row in
    the thread happens to be in the future hides exactly the thing the person
    has to look at. So a pending message says nothing and the run before it

    A scheduled `sent` with NO turn yet is the other promise: the session
    started and the watcher has not pronounced it over, so it has nothing to

    under Done while the dock said thinking. Scheduled only: a CHAT message's
    empty turn means the transcript's own liveness ran out, which has no
    watcher behind it and keeps its old reading.

    A turn the user STOPPED (`cancelled`) still answers `done` — the lane for
    a settled outcome — and the word "Stopped" rides on the message's `turn`
    (`_entry_turn`), so the board and the dock describe the stop identically.

    `error` joins `unknown` in the blocked answers: it is a chat turn whose
    last reply out of the transcript was an API failure (`_reply_fate`), which is a

    not heard back from. A turn thinking through a long tool call appends
    nothing and reads as not-live; a session a human is typing into has no
    scheduler entry at all.

    admission reservation read as running (2026-09-12) — because nothing on
    disk said a turn had started until `claude` registered. #1163 answers that
    for every send, flag or no flag: the page marks the session the moment it
    sends and `_live` believes the mark. One mechanism for one fact; closing the
    double-spawn gap is the queue's own job and is now the manager's owner
    (`queue_manager.started`, filed by the admission).

    Its own function so `_status`'s first rule and anything else that has to ask
    cannot drift apart about what "running" means. The third way — a message of
    this task's own that is in flight — is `_message_running`, and `_status`

    A FOURTH half, checked first and only to say no: the queue manager's own
    word that this session's turn already ended (`tasks_watch.mark_turn_ended`,
    off the session host's `turn_ended`/`exited` event), for the one gap
    neither `live` nor `busy` can see through. On a folder handoff the manager
    knows the turn is over before anything on disk agrees — the registry row
    can still read `busy` until Claude Code next rewrites it, and the
    transcript's own tail is inside `session_liveness`'s window for the CLI's
    closing records, which land a beat later still. Both of those feed `live`
    (`_live`, `tasks_watch.live_from_registry`), so without this a finished
    task and the one the manager just handed the folder to could both read
    `in_progress` for as long as that gap lasts — never two OWNERS, but two
    rows saying so. `tasks_watch.is_turn_ended` is itself "ended, and nothing
    NEWER disagrees" (a fresher mark, or a registry row truly rewritten busy
    since), so this does not discount a genuinely new turn on the same

    to finished within seconds of the result row landing — the watcher records
    the turn's verdict the moment it sees it — while this page kept answering In
    Progress for the rest of the liveness window, because the transcript's tail
    had been written to seconds ago. Of course it had: the records were the
    finished turn's OWN closing rows. Counting a run's obituary as a pulse is
    how the two surfaces disagreed about the same run for up to a minute.

    So: when the newest thing that actually HAPPENED in this thread is a
    scheduled run that has spoken (`_message_verdict` — done or failed), and no
    message claims to be running by its own state, bare liveness has nothing
    left to attest and the caller sets it aside. `ran_at` is the comparison on
    both sides because it is the one stamp that means "happened": a prompt the
    user types after the run is a chat message with a newer `ran_at`, so a
    genuinely new turn keeps its In Progress. The tie goes to the verdict — the
    prompt a scheduled run fired is consumed by the join (`_merge`) and cannot
    also stand on the chat side, so an equal stamp is the run's own.

    BUT THE VERDICT MAY ONLY SILENCE ITS OWN ECHO (TASK-001, Akshil,
    2026-08-19: a task wore the green Done ring while Claude was visibly still
    building the app in its session). A resolved turn is not the end of a
    conversation — the session can keep working with no new prompt to show for
    it (follow-up turns, background work), and none of that is a "message"
    here, so the newest thing that HAPPENED stayed the verdict for as long as
    the work ran and the suppression never lifted. `active` is the transcript's
    own answer — the timestamp of its newest real (non-housekeeping) record —
    and `turn_at` is the moment the watcher pronounced the turn over: a tail

# --------------------------------------------------- what a run is waiting on
# A run parked on a card nobody has answered is invisible from every fact this
# module already reads. The transcript stops growing, the process stays alive,
# `busy_sessions` still holds the send — which is precisely the shape of a slow
# turn, and precisely why an unattended session gets stuck for hours (Akshil,
# 2026-09-03: "when a task is waiting for approval it should give a notification
# and indicator in task needs attention").
#
# The one place the fact is written down is the RUN DIR: `perm/<id>.req.json`
# with no `.res.json` beside it (agent.py `_permissions`). So the listing looks
# there — once per listing, over the runs tree, rather than once per row: the
# scan is `os.listdir` plus a couple of small reads per live run, and doing it
# per row would re-read every run dir once for every task on the machine.
#
# READ ONLY, and through the sanctioned seam. agent.py is a TEMPLATE, outside the
# package's import graph by design (SPEC PY-15), and `claude_spawn.load_agent()`
# is how in-process readers reach it — canvases.py's `_agent_module` is the same
# door for the same reason. Nothing here writes a decision: answering a card is
# the chat's job, and a listing that could deny one would be a poll with a
# verdict in it.

# How many run dirs one scan reads, and the walk itself, are both
# `project_queue.scan_runs` — ONE bounded pass over the tree, shared with the
# holder derivation. There used to be two of them, and a listing paid for both:
# the same 120 directories opened twice for one /api/tasks, which is exactly the
# cost the bound was there to avoid. See `project_queue.RUN_SCAN_LIMIT` (why the
# tail is cut at all) and `project_queue.SCAN_TTL` (why one walk answers both).

    Three conditions, and all three are load-bearing:

    * **Unanswered.** `_permissions` returns the whole list — answered cards
      included, so a re-attaching frame can rebuild them — and a run whose cards
      were all answered minutes ago is a run that is simply working. Only a
      request with no `decision` is somebody being waited on.
    * **Alive.** A dead process cannot be unblocked, and its last card sits in
      the run dir for ever. A needs-attention row for it would be a lane that
      only ever fills up, with an Open button onto a conversation nobody can
      answer.
    * **Oldest first.** `_permissions` sorts by file name, which is the order the
      requests were raised, so the FIRST unanswered one is the one the run is
      actually blocked on. A later card can exist (a sub-agent's), and reporting
      it would describe a question the user is not being asked yet.

    AND A FOURTH, ONLY WITH THE PROJECT QUEUE ON: **nobody is being waited on if
    the user has already answered.** A card answered while the folder was busy
    leaves no `.res.json` in the run dir — the decision is held
    (`queue_manager.held_answer`) and written when the folder frees — so the
    request still reads as unanswered here. Reporting it would make the row
    `needs_attention`, which sits above `queued` in `_status` and would put
    "Answer queued — runs next" permanently out of reach: the one row the whole
    held-answer path exists to paint could never be painted. The user has
    answered; what the task is waiting on is the folder, which is what `queued`
    says.

    One walk of the runs tree, shared with the manager's `blocked` check
    (`project_queue.scan_runs`) — the `meta.json` and the session ids come back
    already read, and only the pid is touched here.

    AND ONE `_permissions` PER RUN, shared with it too. Both readers ask the
    same run the same question on the same listing — this one what it is parked
    ON, the manager's `blocked` check whether it is parked at all — and the
    answer is a directory listing plus a file per card.
    `project_queue.run_permissions` reads it once
    onto the scanned record, which lives exactly as long as the walk does
    (round-2 review, 2026-09-12).

    Best-effort throughout: a run dir that will not read costs that run's news,
    never the listing.

    THE LINE IS NOT DERIVED HERE ANY MORE (PR 2, 2026-09-17). Where a task
    stands is the queue manager's index — an event-driven pointer table, one
    line per folder, position = array index — and this READS it
    (`queue_manager.positions()`). The stamp-ranked pass that used to live here
    rebuilt the order out of the scheduler's store and the held-answer store on
    every listing, which is exactly the derivation the manager replaces: two
    readers of one order is how a line gets printed one way and run another.

    THE SHAPE IS UNCHANGED, deliberately: `_row` reads these five fields and
    `_name_ahead` fills the other four, so the listing and the client below it
    never learn where the order came from.

    `ahead_key` IS THE TASK DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF THIS ONE, not always the holder
    (Akshil, 2026-09-12) — the manager answers it per item: position 1 behind
    the folder's owner, position n behind position n - 1, with held answers
    stepped over rather than named. "Behind TASK-041" on every card in a line of
    four said the same thing four times.

    `ahead` is the number a reader sees, `ahead_title` the name, and
    `ahead_session` / `ahead_target` the pair a reader CLICKS (tasks-lib
    `taskHref`) — all four filled in by `_name_ahead`, which needs the listing's
    own allocation pass and therefore cannot happen here.

    `tasks`, `now` and `by_id` are the caller's collection, clock and entry map.
    Nothing here needs them now that the order is read rather than computed;

    """The status a task sits in — ONE decision, made here, for every view.

    Derived from the MESSAGES, in this order, and the order is the whole model:

    0. **Running AND parked ⇒ Needs attention.** Above every other rule,
       including the queued one just below, because it is the same fact told
       at a finer grain: the run IS in flight, and it is in flight in the one
       way that never ends on its own — a permission card or a question card
       nobody has answered (`parked`, from `_parked_runs`). "In Progress" is a
       true sentence about it and a useless one: it is the sentence a reader
       waits out, and this run will still be there tomorrow. The moment the
       card is answered the run is ordinary again and rule 2 (running) has it
       back, with nothing to undo — this reads the decision files on every
       poll rather than remembering a verdict.

       PARKED WITHOUT RUNNING IS NOT THIS. `parked` is only ever true for a
       process that is alive (see `_parked_runs`), and the `and` below is
       belt-and-braces for a task whose messages say nothing is going on: a
       needs-attention row nobody can answer any more would be a lane that only
       fills up.

       PARKED IS CHECKED ON ITS OWN, not only as a multiplier on rule 2: a
       hand-typed chat parked on a card fails both of rule 2's tests (the live
       registry reports `waiting`, not running, and the transcript has gone
       quiet), so gating on `_running_now`/`_message_running` first would file
       it `done` before parked ever got a look. `_parked_runs` already proves
       the process is alive — that is enough on its own.

    1. **Standing in the manager's line ⇒ Queued, ABOVE running.** One task in
       progress per folder (`project_queue`): this task has work that is DUE
       and cannot start because another task is holding the working tree it
       edits, or it has a card decision held for delivery when that tree
       frees. The caller decides it (`_queue_lines` → `queue_manager.positions`,
       one derivation per listing, the way `busy` and `parked` are) and hands
       the answer in, because it is a fact about every OTHER task on the
       machine and a function that sees one task's messages cannot reach it.

       ABOVE RULE 2 (running), moved there in the review round of 2026-09-18:
       an answered-blocked task the manager has just promoted to line[0] can
       still have a session that READS live — the registry row has not caught
       up, or the sender's mark has not expired — which is precisely what rule
       2 below is built to trust. The manager, not a stale transcript or
       registry read, is the source of truth for who is running a folder, and
       standing in its line is proof this task is NOT that folder's owner: the
       owner is never a member of `positions()` (`queue_manager.positions`
       walks each folder's `line`, never its `owner`), so `queued` can never
       be true for the task actually holding the folder — nothing further
       needs to check that here.

       ABOVE ARCHIVED too (an unlabelled corollary of the same move): the one
       shape that could read both filed and queued is a filing the thread has
       already overtaken, and by the time this is asked `filed` is already
       False for exactly that case (see `_revived`) — so the two checks do
       not actually compete and the order between them is inert. Above the
       speaker, because the speaker is the last thing that HAPPENED and this
       is the thing that is about to: a task that ran yesterday and has a
       message due into a busy folder today is waiting, not done.

       ONLY WITH THE FLAG ON. `_queue_lines` answers empty when
       `project_queue.enabled()` is false, so nothing here derives `queued` and
       the status is the one main computes.
    2. **Anything else running ⇒ In Progress.** Activity beats recency: a task whose
       newest message is next Tuesday's occurrence, with a run still going in
       it, is a task that is working. Three things say a run is happening and a
       task needs only one — a message of its own that is in flight
       (`_message_running`), a transcript that is live (or a sender's own mark
       that a turn just started, `tasks_watch.mark_running`, which `_live`
       folds in), and `schedule.busy_sessions`, the scheduler's record of a
       send it has not heard back from (see `_running_now`). They are
       independent because each is wrong on its own in a different direction:
       a turn thinking through a long tool call appends nothing for minutes and
       reads as not-live, and a session a human is typing into has no busy
       entry at all. The transcript's vote is withdrawn by the caller for exactly one
       case — the tail's freshness is the finished run's own closing records —
       see `_verdict_outvotes_live`.
    3. **Archived is a filing state.** The task the user put away is archived,
       and so is a task whose every message ended up filed (cancelling the last
       live message in a thread archives the task, without anybody having to say
       so twice). Rule 2 is above this on purpose: a run in flight when the task
       was filed keeps running and the card reads In Progress until it stops.
    4. **Otherwise the newest message that has something to say speaks** —
       `blocked` for a run that broke, `done` for one that ended. See `_speaker`.
    5. **Nothing said yet, but something COMING ⇒ Upcoming**, and that second
       half is the whole of it: the lane is what has not happened *yet*, so it
       needs a message still waiting to happen. A task with nothing coming and
       nothing to report is over, and `done` is where a spent session goes — see
       `_waiting`.

    What is NOT here any more is triage's other two words. A person cannot file
    a task as In Progress (the lane is Claude's output, and the Board no longer
    offers the drop) and cannot file one as Done (a run says that, not a
    reader) — so the stale-pin machinery that used to decide when an automatic
    `in_progress` had outlived its run is gone with the pin it guarded.

    FILING SOMETHING DOES NOT STOP IT (Akshil, 2026-08-18), which is rule 2
    standing above rule 3 and nothing more: Archive is a timeless decision and
    the record is never touched here, but while a turn is genuinely in flight a
    row that says `archived` is a lie the reader can watch. The moment the run
    ends the task drops back into Archive on the next poll.

    `filed` is the ANSWER, not the record: the caller has already asked whether
    the filing still stands (`_archive_record` and `_revived`), because a filing
    a new message has overtaken is dropped from disk rather than argued with on
    every poll. This function reads no triage of its own.

# ----------------------------------------------------------------- the titles


def _title(task: dict, rec: dict | None, first_prompt: str) -> tuple[str, str]:
    """(title, where it came from). The precedence is §4's: what the user called
    it (`user`), then Claude Code's own one-liner for the session (`ai`), then
    the first line of the first message. No summarisation call anywhere — the
    title we want is already written into the transcript once per turn.

    FIVE sources, because the last step has three and they are not equally
    trustworthy:

    * `message` — the session's own first prompt, read out of the transcript
      (`tasks_store.head`). This is the step §4 asks for: "the first message
      that we had", a line the session actually opened with.
    * `entry` — the earliest scheduled message asked OF this session, used only
      when there is no readable transcript to take the line above from. It is
      still the best name here, but for a task scheduled from the New task form
      it is the very message being scheduled, so a client prefilling a Title
      field from it writes the description into the name.
    * `command` — the slash command the session ran, when it contains no prose
      at all. Some sessions really are just `/making-a-release` or `/clear`, and
      that is worth saying: six of the ten genuinely-wordless rows on one real
      machine are this shape, and the row's alternative was the envelope quoted
      back at the user as the name of their own conversation
      (`<command-message>making-a-release</command-message>` — a real title on a
      real machine before this).

    `message` and `entry` are the same shape of string and the client has no way
    to tell them apart by looking. It used to guess — refusing a `message` title
    whenever the composed ask began with it — and a guess cannot tell a
    continuation ("pull today's news" as the session's real first prompt, "pull
    today's news and file it" as the new ask) from an echo, so a session lost the
    name the app already knew. Naming the source is the same information without
    the guess.

    Nothing at all is a real answer, and it stays "": a session with no prose and
    no command has nothing true to be called, and the WORDING of that absence is
    the client's to choose. A placeholder invented here would not stay a
    placeholder — it is what the New task form prefills a Title field with, and a
    prefill the user saves becomes the task's permanent name."""

    The two fields are not synonyms and the difference is the whole of this
    function. `claude_session_id` is the ANSWER — the session the turn actually
    ran in, filled in by the watcher from the run's first reporting tick.
    `session_id` is the INPUT — "resume this conversation", empty meaning
    "start a fresh one".

    Reading only the answer meant an entry that NAMES a conversation but has
    not run yet matched nothing, and fell to `pending:<entry-id>` — a second
    row beside the very task it belongs to, which merged into it the moment the
    watcher reported. Two ordinary things do that: a re-send (it carries the
    failed run's session as its `session_id`, and queues instead of going
    immediately whenever that conversation is mid-turn) and a message scheduled
    out of an open chat.

    **Answer first**, because the two can disagree: a resume that forked into a
    new session RAN in `claude_session_id`, and that is the thread the message
    is in whatever it asked for.

    **"" is not an id.** A message with no `session_id` is asking for a fresh
    session, so it must keep falling through to its own `pending:` key —
    grouping on "" would collapse every unrelated fresh-session message in the
    store into a single row.

    **A FOLLOWER READS ITS LEADER'S ANSWER.** `follow_of` names the message
    this one was typed behind, and it exists for the one shape that has no id of
    its own to give: a second message typed into a brand-new chat whose first
    message is still queued. Grouping it anywhere but with the leader forks a
    second `pending:<id>` row beside the very chat it was typed into, which is
    the bug this field was added for (browser QA, 2026-09-12). So the leader's
    own answer is this entry's answer — and "" here is not a failure, it means
    "the leader has not run either", which `_entry_key` finishes by filing both
    under the LEADER's pending key.

    `by_id` is the store keyed by entry id; a caller mid-pass over the entries
    passes its own map, and one holding a single entry passes nothing and has
    the store read for it — but only for an entry that actually follows one.

    deleted a live row whose replacement had never been rung — it arrived only

    tombstone is the newest thing about the task. Activity that postdates it
    brings the row back, because the alternative is the one thing a hidden task
    must never do — run invisibly. Two kinds of activity can postdate it:

    * **an entry created after the deletion** — a message scheduled into the
      same conversation later. `created` is the entry's own birth stamp; its
      `due` is deliberately not read, because delete cancels pending entries
      and a cancelled entry's future due time is not news, it is a corpse with
      a date on it;
    * **a user message newer than the tombstone** — somebody said something in
      the session after it was hidden: the reader typing into the conversation
      again, or a scheduled message delivered into it, which writes its own
      `type: "user"` row with the moment it landed. That row, found by reading
      backwards from the end of the transcript (`tasks_store.user_row_after`),
      is the evidence. An unreadable file counts as no evidence, not as
      revival: degrading widens nothing here because the
      tombstone still answers, and a task wrongly hidden is recoverable while a
      delete that silently failed is not — the endpoint's answer is the
      receipt.

    A MOVED MTIME IS NOT A MESSAGE (Akshil, 2026-09-20: "hi r1" deleted, back
    half a minute later as a blank done row). The file being newer than the
    tombstone used to BE the second bullet, and it is not evidence: Claude Code
    writes bookkeeping rows on its way out — `last-prompt`, `ai-title`, `mode`,
    `permission-mode`, `atis-latch`, `cost-state` — which re-create a
    transcript an erase has just removed, seconds or minutes later, whenever
    the process behind the session finally goes. None of them carries a
    timestamp and none of them is a `user` row, so none of them can pass the
    test above. The mtime still runs FIRST, as the cheap gate: a file no newer
    than the tombstone is not read at all, and a listing walks every
    transcript on the machine.

    # row prints, shell/tasks-lib.sortByLane — and nothing on the client orders
    # by `started` today. The field stays fixed regardless, for whoever next

    # line is the one line in it that never changes.

    Reporting it only where the mark decided the answer meant it went false the
    instant the registry caught up and said `busy` — so a row could show the
    send, drop back to done two seconds later when the echo rule got its vote
    back, and only return when the prompt reached the transcript. Same lag,
    with a flicker in front of it. The send either happened in the last fifteen
    seconds or it did not, and no other fact makes it un-happen.

    True implies running: `is_marked_running` is the one thing consulted for
    it, and every way a mark is stood down — its own TTL, a registry that went
    `busy` then wasn't, or the sender itself saying the turn ended
    (`mark_idle`, `POST /api/tasks/idle`) — lives there, not here. That last
    one is what keeps a FAST turn from wearing the ring for the rest of the
    mark's fifteen seconds: the reply landing is news the same page can say
    the instant it knows it, same as the send was.

    `session_id` is for the ONE task shape that has no transcript to name
    itself with: a placeholder built out of a live send alone (`_collect`).
    There is no file to read, so the mark is not merely the best evidence
    here — it is all of it. Optional, because every other caller has a path
    and the path already carries the id (the transcript is named for its
    session), and reading it twice could only produce two answers."""

    """When this task NEXT runs, WHICH entry that run is, and whether it REPEATS
    — `(0.0, "", False)` for a task with nothing pending.

    The third is the row's repeat glyph (Akshil, 2026-09-11: "for repeating
    tasks we say 'in 1h [repeat icon]'"): an occurrence carries its template's
    id, and that is the whole test. Decided here, over the same entry the time
    and the id name, so the glyph cannot describe a different run than the one
    the chip is timing — and here rather than on the client because the window
    may not hold the run at all (the paragraph below).

    This exists because the three messages a row carries cannot answer it. The
    tail is the three newest by `at`, and on this branch an OVERDUE pending is an
    ordinary state (past scheduling is allowed, catch-up is unbounded), so two
    sent runs plus next month's occurrence are enough to push the run that should
    happen FIRST out of the window entirely. The Board orders Upcoming by
    soonest-next-run; read from the window alone that order buries exactly the
    work it exists to surface. `min(at)` over every pending entry is the fact the
    lane actually wants, and here — where the whole set is already in hand,
    before the tail is cut — it is free.

    Widening `task.messages` was the other way to close it and is the wrong one:
    a fourth (or twentieth) message is another row of tail held per session for
    every session on the machine, paid on every poll, to fix a minority of rows.

    TWO fields rather than one, because the sort and the button have to widen
    TOGETHER. `runNowTarget` fires an ENTRY ID, and a card promoted to the top of
    Upcoming on a run whose id the row does not carry would Run now some other
    message than the one the order just promised. So an entry with no readable id
    is not eligible to be the named next run at all: naming it would put the lie
    back, one field further along.

    `_entry_at` is the due time and never `fired` (see there), and an entry with
    no readable due time is skipped for the same reason — the alternative is
    claiming the task runs next at the epoch, which would pin it to the top of
    the lane forever.

    On an exact tie the FIRST in store order wins, which is the older of the two
    (the store appends). A tie is also the one case where the client may fire a
    different entry than the one named here: `runNowTarget` prefers a message it
    is HOLDING over an equally-due one it can only name, because that one has a
    printed id. Both are due at the same second, so the time the lane orders by
    is the same either way and the order still promises what the button sends.

    """One listing row. The tail parse only: three messages, and a count.

    `parked` is `_parked_runs()` — every session whose live run is waiting on a
    card — computed once by the caller for the same reason `busy` is: it is one
    scan of the runs tree, and asking it per row would re-read every run dir once
    per task on the machine.

    `busy` is `schedule.busy_sessions` over the WHOLE store, computed once by
    the caller — one of the three things that say a run is happening (see
    `_status`). Over the whole store rather than this task's
    own entries because a resume that forked is filed under the session it RAN
    in (`_entry_session` reads the answer first) while it still holds the
    session it NAMED busy, and that one is another row.

    `queue` is `_queue_lines()` — every task waiting on a busy folder, with its
    place in the line — computed once by the caller for the third time on this
    list of parameters and for the same reason: it is one scan of the runs tree
    and one pass over the scheduler's store, and it answers about tasks other
    than this one. None means nobody asked (the single-row callers below) or the
    project-queue flag is off, and the row then carries no queue fields at all.

    `queue_on` is the flag, read once by the caller. FLAG OFF IS MAIN, FIELD FOR
    FIELD: `queue_key` is a folder derivation only this feature has a use for,
    and resolving one per row — walking a task's ancestors looking for a `.git`
    — is work main never did. So it is `""` with the flag off, like every other
    queue field on this row, and the folder appears the moment the feature is
    turned on. None means "ask", for the single-row callers that have no listing
    to have read it in.


    `chat_drafts` is `drafts.list_chat()`, read once by the caller for the same
    reason `read` and the numbers are: it is one file, and asking it per row
    would open it once per task on the machine. Joined on the SESSION ID rather
    than the key, because that is what the composer keys on — a `pending:` row
    has no conversation to have been typed into, and a `new:<file>` draft has no
    row at all until its first send makes the session (design.md, "Chat draft
    key").

    `bound_chips` is `_bound_chips(task_drafts)` — the OTHER draft that can be
    about this conversation: a New task form somebody opened out of it and has
    not sent. Read once by the caller, like `chat_drafts`, and joined on the
    same session id. It fills two fields and nothing else: `bound_draft`, which
    names the draft row standing in for this one, and — only when the composer
    itself is empty — `draft`, so the row wears the chip either way. A chat
    draft WINS, because that one is literally sitting in this conversation's
    composer while the form is a message about to be scheduled into it.

    `settings` is `tasks_store.settings_state()` — the per-session model/effort
    record — read once by the caller for the same reason `read` is: it is one
    file, and asking it per row would open it once per task on the machine.
    None means nobody read it, and the row then answers off the task's own
    entries alone (`_row_settings`), which is what the three single-row callers
    below want: none of them draws a pill.

    `last_message` — whether the row carries the newest thing the user said —
    is True for the listing and False for the three single-row callers below,
    none of which reads the field. False leaves the key OFF the row entirely
    rather than sending a null, and the client reads an absent key as
    "nothing said". (Until 2026-09-20 this followed the `task_card_last_message`
    pref, an experiment that titled the row by that message; the pref is gone
    and the listing always carries the field now.)

    `revived` is an OUT parameter and the only one: a session whose archive
    record this row has just found stale is appended to it, and the caller does
    the write. Collected rather than written here because building a row is
    inside a per-task `try` that swallows IO errors — a failed write would cost
    the row instead of costing the filing."""

    message Run now was pressed on counts from that moment rather than from next
    Tuesday. Without the folder because this is a count of MESSAGES, not a place
    in a line: a task with two queued sends says "2 messages waiting" whether or

    composer — the scheduler was about to send it into this very session, and a
    line typed over it is two messages racing into one run. Under the queue a

    and never block. What is left is the message somebody SCHEDULED into this

    row. So every row this builder makes belongs to nobody, and `session_id`
    below is always "" in practice — emitted anyway because one row shape is one
    row shape.

    IT DOES HAVE A NUMBER. Round 1 printed `task_id: ""` here on the reasoning
    that a number is minted when a task becomes real; round 2 reversed that,
    because the number is how a person NAMES the thing ("what happened to
    TASK-118?") and a draft they have been typing into for ten minutes is
    already a thing they can name. `draft:<id>` is allocated through exactly
    the path `pending:<entry-id>` uses and is rekeyed forward onto
    `pending:<entry-id>` when the draft is scheduled, so the number the row
    showed while it was a form is the number it keeps once it is a task
    (design.md, "Round 2"; Akshil, 2026-09-11). A SESSION-BOUND draft is the
    one exception and it never gets this far: the number already exists, on the
    session, so nothing is allocated for it and nothing is moved when it is
    scheduled (`_draft_numbers`, and the schedule router's own rekey guard).

    The three fields `_row` has no use for — `draft_kind`, `cwd` and `file` —
    are carried by BOTH draft kinds rather than by whichever needs them, for
    the same reason the rest of the set is: one row shape, tested once.

    `form` is the WHOLE stored draft, which is the one field here that is not
    about drawing the row: clicking a draft row reopens the modal on it, and
    the modal needs every field back, not a summary. It is small — one form —
    and fetching it separately would mean a request between the click and the
    modal, which is exactly the pause the feature exists to remove.

    `tasks_store.ensure_ids` and nothing else — the same call, the same file
    and the same allocate-once promise the listing's `_numbers` uses, because
    the whole point is that the number a draft shows is the number its task
    will keep. The project each draft is numbered in is the FOLDER it is
    pointed at, which is what `_workdir` resolves and what both row builders
    above print.

    Over EVERY draft, never the `only` subset: `ensure_ids` hands numbers out
    in the order it is given them, so numbering a narrowed set would let the
    changes endpoint allocate in a different order than the listing does.

    Sorted by when the draft was started, the same `order` the listing passes,
    so a backfill over a store that predates numbering reads in the order the
    drafts were actually typed. Degrades to no numbers on an unwritable state
    dir, exactly like `_numbers`: blank numbers, never a lost page.

    `reproject=True` is the ONE way this differs from `_numbers`, and it is the
    one thing a draft has that a task does not: a folder the user can still
    change. The number is allocated at the first keystroke, under the folder the
    modal opened on — change the folder afterwards and the number allocated in
    the old project rode along into the new one, which is how a list of
    TASK-001…015 came to show a TASK-202. A draft's number belongs to the
    project it points at NOW, so the store drops the old mapping and allocates
    afresh (`tasks_store.ensure_ids`); the old number stays spent, a gap in the
    project it was minted in. Nothing is renumbered once the draft is scheduled
    — that rekey onto `pending:` is what fixes it for good (Akshil,
    2026-09-11). `new:<file>` chat drafts carry their file IN the key and so can
    never move, which is why one flag covers both kinds here.

    A SESSION-BOUND TASK DRAFT IS NOT NUMBERED AT ALL, and that absence is the
    point (Akshil, 2026-09-12). Such a draft is a message being written INTO a
    conversation that already has a number, and the reported bug was exactly
    that a second one got minted: exit the modal, reopen the draft, press
    Schedule, and the task the reader had been watching as TASK-118 came back as
    TASK-119 in a session of its own. Such a draft has no row of its own to put
    a number on either (`_draft_rows` skips it; the session's row wears the
    chip), so nothing on the page goes blank — what does not happen is an
    allocation. `ensure_ids` is never told about the key, so `reproject` cannot
    spend anything under it either.

    chip prints). Nothing is hidden, nothing stands in for anything, and a
    click on the row opens the chat like every other session row; the way back
    into the form is the composer's Schedule hop, which reopens it by id.

    THE PREVIEW IS THE DRAFT'S FIRST LINE, title before description: the title
    is what the reader named this thing and what the chip's tooltip should say,

def _settle_new_chats(chat_drafts: dict, task_drafts: dict) -> bool:
    """Walk a STRANDED draft TASK number onto the session the send that SPENT
    it created. True if anything moved.

    TWO KEY SHAPES, one rule. A session-less composer used to draft only under
    `new:<file>`; it can also send out of a TASK DRAFT now, and the key it tags
    that run with is then the draft's own `draft:<id>` (`drafts.task_key`).
    Both shapes are rows with a number of their own, both stop being a row when
    the send spends them, and in both the number has to follow the session the
    send makes — so both are read here, under the same hands-off rule: a key
    whose RECORD still exists (a saved chat draft, a task draft still in the
    drafts store) is not this function's to touch. The composer DELETEs the
    task draft's record as it sends, so the number moves on the first build
    after that delete has landed; a build that gets there first just asks
    again.

    A SEND NEVER TOUCHES A SAVED DRAFT (blocker, 2026-09-16). This used to
    `delete_chat` the record too, and that was the truth while the composer
    autosaved on every keystroke: the record WAS the message going out, and the
    transcript took the words over in the same tick. The composer autosaves
    nothing now (caef75eb1, `ui/Composer.tsx` — "a send just sends"), so a
    `new:<file>` record exists only because the reader ASKED for one — "Save as
    draft" in the leave guard, or Schedule → Continue — and a send is not an
    answer to that question. Type, leave, save as draft, come back, type
    something else, send: the saved Upcoming row and its number both stand, and
    the session the send makes gets a number of its own. So a key that still
    HAS a record is not settled here at all. What is left for this to settle is
    the NUMBER ALONE — a `new:<file>` key that carries one in `task_ids` with
    no record behind it, the row the reader was watching left on a key nothing
    reads again.

    THE SEND NAMES ITS OWN DRAFT, and nothing here infers it. A chat with no
    session drafts under `new:<file>` and is numbered under that key; the first
    send creates the session, and a number with no record left to hold it has
    to follow that session or it is stranded for good. So the
    composer's session-less send puts the key it is spending in the start
    request (`protocol/run-controller.ts`, `draft_key`), `agent._start` writes
    it into `meta.json` verbatim before it spawns anything, and this reads it
    back. The draft key is a RECEIPT written by the process that spent it,
    which is the one thing about that send nobody has to guess at.

    WHY NOT THE TARGET. The first build of this matched a run to a draft by
    "same file, and `resumed_from` is empty" — a first-ever run on that
    folder — and every OTHER way a folder gets its first run passes those same
    two guards: a scheduled task's first fire (`schedule.py::_send` →
    `claude_spawn.spawn_helper` → `agent._start`), a `new_task_each_run` entry,
    canvases.py's own spawn. Any of them would have taken the number off a chat
    the reader was still typing into — and, in the build that still deleted,
    the unsent words with it (review, 2026-09-12). None of them sends a
    `draft_key`, so none of them can claim a number now.

    (The four rounds before that asked the CLIENT which session its own send
    created, and each answer was an inference with a gap — a send that threw, a
    refusal that never left `idle`, a Back before the id landed — that left the
    move owed to whichever session id turned up next. Tagging the run is not
    that: the page is not saying which session it made, it says which draft
    it spent, which it knows at the moment it spends it.)

    WHERE IT RUNS. `agent.py` is a TEMPLATE — outside the package's import
    graph by design (SPEC PY-15), so it cannot call `tasks_store` or `drafts`
    at the moment it learns the id — and a chat's own run is started and polled
    in an executor subprocess, never in this process. The nearest thing the
    server has to that moment is the build below: it is the only reader of the
    number, it already scans this tree for parked runs, and it runs BEFORE
    `_numbers` allocates, so the session this settles is still unnumbered when
    it gets here. Latency is one listing (the changes long-poll the chat itself
    holds, in practice).

    TWO GUARDS BESIDES THE KEY:

    * **A record, and this key is not ours.** A `new:<file>` key with a saved
      draft behind it — or a `draft:<id>` key whose task draft is still in the
      store — is a row the reader put there on purpose; its number is that
      row's, not the send's. Excluded before the tree is read at all, so no
      tagged run can claim it however old or new the save is.
    * **A session id, or nothing happens.** A run that never got one (`_start`
      failed, the CLI died before its first row) has nothing to carry the
      number to. Asked again on the next build.

    `entry["model"]` / `entry["effort"]` straight to
    `claude_spawn.spawn_helper`, which hands them to `claude --model` /
    `--effort` (`agent._claude_argv`), so for a task that has not run yet there

    first run on, the conversation records what it actually launched with and

    changed the chat, not the task's booked messages.

    WHY THE ROW CARRIES THEM AT ALL, when the design says the card asks and the
    list stays quiet (NewJobModal's own note): nothing here DRAWS them. They are
    for the side peek, whose composer is a real chat — and a chat with no

    settings they had not chosen (Akshil, 2026-09-18).

    NEWEST FIRST, and PER FIELD. A task is a thread and a thread can hold
    several scheduled messages; the newest that names a setting is the one a
    reader is about to act on — the same rule `_description` takes over the same
    list. Per field rather than per entry because an entry that pinned only the
    effort must not wipe a model an earlier one pinned; that is also how
    `agent._defaults` fills its own two fields.

    "" IS A REAL ANSWER and the load-bearing one. It means "this task has no
    opinion", which is what leaves the chat's own detection speaking for every
    conversation that never went through the New task card. Answering "sonnet"

    the CLI's own registry row lands two to four seconds later. So the sender
    says it, once, at the moment it sends — `run-controller.ts`, beside the
    `announceTasksChanged` it already fires on both turn boundaries.

    A FLOOR WITH A FUSE, not a status (tasks_watch.mark_running): it expires by

    A session id with no task row yet is not an error: a brand-new chat's

    reopening a row a later idle call already closed (bugbot #1163).

    `text` and `file` are what the sender SAID and what it said it about, and
    they turn this from a floor under a row into the row itself: a brand-new
    chat has no transcript, no entry and no session on disk for its first
    seconds, so without them the send is a task nothing can list. With them the
    listing has a placeholder — keyed by the session the turn runs in, which is
    what `POST /api/run` hands the page back — that the transcript then simply
    becomes. Both are optional and neither can pin anything: they live and die
    with the mark, and the worst a wrong call does is show one wrong line for

    hourly case (one chip carrying `+23`) could never occur at all. So the

    messages for these bounds with what comes back, so a partial answer silently
    drops chips. Every scheduled message a task has inside the bounds is here.

    `from` is inclusive and `to` exclusive, in epoch seconds — the client sends
    local-midnight bounds because its columns are local days, and the message at

    of each of its scheduled entries.

    A task that is no longer a task (`_is_task`) has no chips here either — the

    of the same store, and the chip's own row would be unreachable.

# door reads that one record. `session_id` rather than a task key because this
# is a fact about a CONVERSATION — most chats are not tasks, and the ones that
# are share the id anyway.

# What `effort` may be — the claude composer's EFFORTS list, and `""` for "not
# saying", which is how a pick of the model alone reaches this. The model is
# NOT checked against a list here: the CLI is the authority on what `--model`
# takes, no Python vocabulary in this package tracks it, and a server list that

# ------------------------------------------------------------------ archiving
# Archiving is the only filing decision a person makes about a task, and it is
# ONE gesture with two halves — which is why it is a verb here and not a triage
# write from the client:
#
#   * the SESSION is filed (triage.json `archived`, the same record the Inbox
#     writes and reads), so the transcript keeps its place and its notes;
#   * the WORK IS CALLED OFF. A task with a run booked for tomorrow that is
#     "archived" but still fires is not archived at all — it is a card that
#     re-appears in Upcoming on its own, which is the one thing filing something
#     away must never do. So every pending message is cancelled, and so is every
#     recurring RULE behind one, because a rule that keeps materialising
#     occurrences is a rule that keeps un-archiving the task.
#
# WHAT IS NOT TOUCHED is a run that is happening. `sending` is not cancellable
# (schedule.cancel refuses it, and rightly: the helper is away and the turn may
# have started) and neither is a live turn. Those keep going, the task keeps
# reading In Progress while they do, and it settles into Archive by itself when
# they end — see `_message_archived`. Nothing has to come back and finish the
# job; the derivation simply answers differently once nothing is running.
#
# Deleting exists now (Akshil, 2026-08-19) and D306 still holds, because the
# two were never actually in tension: what the user asks to delete is the ROW —
# the task's place on the List, the Board, the calendar and the sidebar — and
# what D306 protects is the TRANSCRIPT. So delete is archive's first half
# (cancel the pending work, rules included) plus a TOMBSTONE in tasks_store
# where archive writes a triage record; the transcript stays on disk, reachable
# through Claude Code itself, and new activity in the conversation revives the
# row (`_deleted`) rather than running behind a hidden task. A task that never
# ran disappears the moment its work is cancelled anyway — `_is_task`'s rule,
# older than either verb — and the tombstone is what extends that to tasks
# that HAVE a session to keep.

    THE MOVE HAS ONE MEANING AND NO DESTINATION. Dragging a card out of the
    Archive lane does not say which lane it should land in — the user drops it
    somewhere because that is how a card leaves a lane, and where it goes is
    DERIVED (`_status`) exactly as it is for every other task on the board. So
    this verb takes a key and no status, and the lane the user happened to drop
    on is not sent, not read and not honoured. `status` in the answer is where
    the task actually landed, which is the one thing the client cannot work out
    for itself before its next poll — and it may well not be the lane under the
    cursor. That is correct: the board shows what the work is doing.

    ONE HALF, unlike archiving's two. Archiving cancels the pending work AND
    files the session; this only un-files. The cancelled runs stay cancelled —
    a booked run that came back to life because somebody unarchived a card
    would be a message firing that nobody asked for twice, and "put this back
    on the board" is not consent to send it. Ask for the run again (or say
    something in the conversation) if that is what is wanted.

    NO RUN IS EVER STARTED HERE, which is why the drop onto In Progress is this
    same call and not a run: In Progress is Claude's output, never a verdict a
    reader hands down, so a card dropped there simply comes back and lands
    wherever its thread puts it — Done, Failed or In Progress if a turn really
    is live.

    `clear_triage` keeps the rest of the record — a note, a tag, a read mark on
    that session is somebody else's data and outlives the status the Board put
    on it. Same function the revival rule calls (`_revived`), so the gesture and
    the automatic way out of Archive drop the filing identically.

    """Take the row away for good: cancel its pending work, tombstone its key.

    Archive's first half — the rules first, then every pending entry, for the
    reason documented there — and then `tasks_store.mark_deleted` where archive
    writes triage: the tombstone is what `_collect` reads, so the task is
    absent from the listing, the pulse, the calendar and the full thread in one
    decision, exactly the way `_is_task` already drops shells.

    THE RULES, FOUND BY WHERE THEIR NEXT RUN WOULD LAND (bugbot, 2026-08-19,
    twice — once in each direction). Archive's `_rules_behind` reads template
    ids off PENDING occurrences only — right for archive, whose cancelled runs
    must not reach past the task, but blind to a live rule BETWEEN occurrences:
    the materialiser mints lazily, so such a rule has no pending row, survives
    the delete, and its next mint carries a `created` stamp newer than the
    tombstone — the revival rule's front door (`_deleted`). The over-correction
    was as wrong the other way: harvesting `template_id` off every entry
    whatever its state cancelled a `new_task_each_run` SERIES because one of
    its spent runs happened to be the task being deleted — a series whose
    future runs mint into fresh sessions and were never going to touch this
    row. So `_every_rule_behind` asks the one question that matters: would this
    rule's next run land back ON THIS TASK? Those rules die with the row;
    every other rule survives it, and only this task's own pending entries are
    withdrawn.

    REFUSED WHILE THE TASK IS RUNNING (409). A live turn cannot be cancelled
    (`sending` is refused by schedule.cancel, a running job is the registry's
    to stop), so deleting now would hide work that is still happening — a run
    finishing into an invisible task is the exact failure the revival rule
    exists to prevent, and the honest answer is "stop it first". The status
    asked is the same derived row every view paints (`_row`), so this endpoint
    cannot disagree with the pill the user is looking at.

    AND REFUSED FOR A WORD THE ROW CANNOT SAY (`_queue_holds_live`). With the
    project queue on, a run parked on a card the user has already answered
    reads `queued` — the decision is held until the folder frees, so the run
    is not "parked" any more and not yet running again — and neither status
    word above catches it. The queue is asked directly instead: it is the only
    thing that knows a process is standing behind that key.

    AND THE QUEUE IS TOLD (`_queue_drop_task`). Cancelling the task's entries
    takes its MESSAGES out of the line one at a time; the line item the queue
    minted for itself and the decision it is holding answer to the key alone,
    and a delete that left them behind let a later delivery resume the run and
    bring the row back.

    WHAT IS AND IS NOT ERASED, in the answer as in fact: pending work is
    cancelled (`cancelled` counts it), the row is gone everywhere, and the
    TRANSCRIPT IS NOT TOUCHED (D306) — `erased_transcript` is always False and
    is in the payload so the client never has to guess. The task's number is
    likewise never reallocated (task_ids.json's "max seen plus one" rule), so
    a deleted TASK-007 does not quietly become somebody else's name.

    """Delete the task AND the Claude session behind it — through and through.

    THIS DELIBERATELY GOES FURTHER THAN `/api/tasks/delete`, whose whole promise
    is the opposite one: that verb cancels the work and tombstones the key while
    the TRANSCRIPT IS NOT TOUCHED (D306), so the conversation is still there to
    open and later activity in it revives the row. That is right for the
    Calendar's soft delete and wrong for what the user asked for (Akshil,
    2026-09-07): deleting a task "through and through: deleting the claude
    session itself". Both verbs therefore exist, the softer one unchanged, and
    this one is D307 — the new decision that a task's delete may destroy the
    session, because the user said so about this task, once, in a modal that
    says it cannot be undone.

    THE SAME FIRST HALVES AS DELETE, for the reasons documented there and not
    repeated here: the 409 while a run is in flight (a live turn cannot be
    cancelled, and erasing the transcript under a writing process is worse than
    hiding it) — the queue's reading of that included — then
    `_every_rule_behind` before the task's own pending entries so a rule cannot
    mint one back, and the task out of the queue (`_queue_drop_task`) before
    anything comes off the disk.

    WHAT COMES OFF THE DISK, and why each is plural. `<session_id>.jsonl` is
    globbed across EVERY project dir rather than read off the row's own path,
    because copy-on-resume can leave the same session id under two encoded cwds
    and erasing one of them would leave the conversation readable — and the row
    revivable — from the other. Beside each transcript, the sibling DIRECTORY
    `<session_id>/` holds the subagent sidecars Claude Code writes for that
    session; it is the same conversation and goes with it (`shutil.rmtree`).
    Everything is realpath-checked against PROJECTS_DIR and anything landing
    outside is SKIPPED, not raised on: this is the one endpoint that removes
    trees, so a symlinked project dir must not be able to aim it at ~.

    WHAT COMES OUT OF STATE: the triage record WHOLE (`forget_triage`, not
    `clear_triage` — there is no session left for a note or a tag to be about),
    and the read marks (`tasks_store.forget_session`), and BOTH shapes of this
    session's unsent text — its chat draft and any task draft bound to it
    (`drafts.delete_bound`, 2026-09-15) — with the bound draft's own key
    announced beside this task's, so a page holding a row under it drops it.
    The task's NUMBER is the
    one thing kept: allocation is "max seen plus one" read straight off
    task_ids.json, so the mapping stays as a reservation and a reused TASK-007
    can never point at somebody else's work. See `forget_session`.

    AND THE TOMBSTONE ANYWAY (`mark_deleted`). Nothing should be left to
    revive, but a straggler — a scheduled entry that lands between the cancel
    and the erase, a watcher mid-lap holding the file it just read — must not
    be able to put the row back for a poll. The tombstone costs a few bytes and
    closes that window; the same reasoning delete's docstring gives for it.

# --------------------------------------------------------------- the queue verbs
# ONE TASK IN PROGRESS PER FOLDER, from the client's side. Three POSTs, and they
# exist because the client cannot derive any of them: who holds a folder is a
# fact the queue manager keeps (`queue_manager.owner`), and a page guessing it
# is how two views end up disagreeing about one task.
#
# ALL THREE CARRY THE D3 X-FUSED HEADER, unlike every other write in this file.
# The reads here are unguarded and so is `POST /api/tasks/read` — it moves a
# badge, it does not run code — but these START WORK: admit spawns a turn or
# stores a message that will spawn one, skip moves a message to the head of the
# line it is about to go out of, and decide releases a parked agent. That is the
# exact pair (schedule / unschedule) the header guard covers next door in
# routers/schedule.py, and a blind cross-origin POST must not reach any of them.
#
# THE BODIES ARE PLAIN DICTS, not pydantic models like the archiving verbs above,
# and for the reason `api_schedule_shot` documents: a required model field is
# validated by FastAPI BEFORE any of our code runs, so a malformed body would be
# answered with an unguarded 422 rather than with the guard's 403. A guarded
# endpoint reads its own body.
#
# AND ALL THREE NOW HAND THE DECISION TO ONE PLACE (PR 2, 2026-09-17). The
# manager below is the single record of who owns a folder and who is behind
# them; these endpoints state an EVENT ("this chat wants to send", "this one
# next", "this card is answered") and read the answer back. Nothing here derives
# a line any more.


# ------------------------------------------------------------- wiring the manager
# `queue_manager` owns the index and none of the machinery: spawning a turn,
# replaying a decision and reading whether a session is running are all things
# this process can do and that module must not import (the scheduler, this
# router and the permission server all reach the manager, so an import edge the
# other way is a cycle — see `queue_manager.set_factory`). The five callables
# below are that machinery, and `_wire_manager` is the hook.

    ASKED BEFORE THE SEND, NEVER AFTER. A composer that spawned first and queued
    second would have two runs in one folder for as long as the round trip takes,
    which is the single thing this feature exists to prevent. So the client asks,
    and gets one of two answers:

    * `{"run": true}` — go, exactly as before. The folder is free, or the thing
      holding it IS this session (a second message typed into a conversation
      that is already running is the inbox-absorb case the chat has always had,
      and gating it would be this feature refusing a send that touches nothing
      new). A short reservation is taken on the way out: between this answer and
      the CLI registering a session there is nothing on disk saying the folder is
      taken, and a second send landing in that window would be admitted into it.
      **AND THE SAME ANSWER FOR A CHAT WITH A LIVE RUN OF ITS OWN IN A FOLDER
      THE INDEX GIVES TO SOMEBODY ELSE** — which is exactly what
      `POST /api/tasks/queue/force` leaves behind, on purpose. That chat is a
      stranger in the tree for the rest of its life, so the claim below can only
      ever refuse it; the send is still an absorb into the process already
      there, and it spawns nothing (`own_run_alive`).
    * `{"run": false, ...}` — the words are SAFE and nothing spawned. The message
      is stored as an ordinary pending entry due now, in the same store the
      calendar, the queue popover and cancel already work against, so there is no
      second kind of waiting message to keep in step with. The answer says where
      in the line it landed and who is in front, which is what the bubble's chip
      prints.

    **The flag off answers `{"run": true}` and stores nothing**, which is what
    lets the client ask unconditionally and still behave exactly as main does.

    **AND EITHER ANSWER RINGS THE LONG-POLL.** The row changes on both roads —
    `queued` for a stored message, `in_progress` for an admitted one, the latter
    off the reservation this endpoint takes (`_running_now`) — and a page
    waiting on `/api/tasks/changes` should not sit out its own timeout to hear
    about a send it just made.

    The entry is created through the schedule router's own `create_entry`, so a
    queued send carries the model, the effort, the permission mode and the
    attachments the user actually chose. A queued message that differed from the
    one that would have gone had the folder been free would make this a feature
    that changes work rather than one that delays it.

    **A CHAT NEVER OVERTAKES ITSELF.** A session that already has due work
    waiting in the scheduler — an earlier message of its own that queued — is
    answered `run: false` and this message queues behind it, EVEN IF THE FOLDER
    IS FREE. Two reasons, and the second is the load-bearing one: message order
    in a conversation is the conversation, so the second thing typed must not be
    the first thing sent; and a client that spawned a turn into a session the
    scheduler is about to claim for the earlier message would put two `--resume`
    processes on one transcript. So the order flows through one place, and the
    answer carries `behind_own: true` — the folder may be perfectly free and
    there may be nobody ahead to name, and "after your previous message" is what
    the chip says then.

    A `follow_of` body (a second message typed into a chat whose first is still
    queued) is the same rule read through the leader, and an id that names no
    entry is a 400 rather than a silent fresh task — the client is looking at a
    queue that has moved on, and the honest answer is what makes it refetch.

    **`run_id` IS THE NAME A CHAT HAS BEFORE IT HAS A SESSION.** A new chat's
    first message is admitted with `session_id: ""` because Claude Code has not
    minted one yet, and the run that message starts is anonymous for as long as
    nothing has polled it. So the second message — which by then DOES carry a
    session id — asked about a folder held by a process neither id could match,
    and was told `#1 in line · behind a run in this folder`: queued behind
    itself (Akshil, folder qa-folder-b, 2026-09-12). The client passes the run
    it started; the folder's owner carries the run it is; equal run ids are one
    conversation whatever the session says (`queue_manager.is_free`). The other
    half of the same fix learns the run's session from the live registry by pid,
    so the anonymous window is now seconds rather than minutes
    (`project_queue.run_sessions`).

    **`draft_key` IS THE DRAFT THIS SEND SPENT**, and it is how a queued chat
    keeps the name it already had. A session-less composer autosaves under
    `new:<file>` and the listing numbers that key, so the row the reader has been
    watching is TASK-057 before a word of it has gone anywhere. Queueing it used
    to mint a SECOND number for `pending:<entry-id>` and leave the spent key in
    `task_ids.json` for ever — the reader watched TASK-057 become TASK-058 on the
    send, and every later listing paid a scan of the runs tree for a draft
    nothing would settle (`_settle_new_chats`). The client names the key it is
    spending, exactly as the run it would otherwise have started names it
    (`agent._start`'s `meta.json draft_key`), and the entry inherits both the
    number and the delete (`schedule.spend_chat_draft`). Optional, and ignored
    when the folder was free: a send that RUNS spends its draft the way it always
    did, through the run it starts.

    **A WORDLESS SEND IS REFUSED ONLY WHERE IT WOULD HAVE TO BE STORED.** The
    composer lets a user send pictures with no words, and into a free folder
    that is an ordinary send this must not stand in the way of — so the message
    is not looked at until the answer is "queue it". At that point it has to
    become a scheduled entry, and `schedule.create` refuses one with no message
    whatever it is carrying ("message: cannot be empty" — pictures are not words
    and the row would have nothing to say). Mirrored here rather than routed
    around: answering `run: true` to dodge the store would put a second turn in
    a folder another task is holding, which is the one thing this endpoint
    exists to prevent. So it is a 400 with the store's own sentence, and the
    client keeps the words in the composer.

    **IT NEVER INTERRUPTS THE RUN IN FLIGHT** (Akshil, 2026-09-12). Skip is a
    statement about the ORDER of what is waiting, not about what is happening:
    the holder keeps the folder until its turn ends, and this task goes first
    when it frees. So the answer is always position 1 and never "running now" —
    there is no gesture in this app that takes a folder off a live process.

    **`manager.skip` IS THE WHOLE MECHANISM** (PR 2, 2026-09-17): the task moves
    to index 0 of its folder's line — right behind the owner — and is marked
    promoted, which is what lights the ⤒ on the row. Newest press wins, so a
    later skip pushes this one to 2; that is the rule the old stamp ordering was
    trying to express, stated once in the index instead of re-derived from
    `priority_at` on every read.

    `schedule.set_priority` is still written and now means only one thing: the
    calendar page's existing queued display reads the store's flag. NOTHING
    ORDERS BY IT any more. Only the task's DUE work is promoted — a message the
    same task has scheduled for next Tuesday is not in this line and jumping it
    to the head of one would be this verb silently rescheduling work nobody
    asked about.

    REFUSED (400) WHEN THE TASK IS NOT QUEUED, rather than quietly setting a flag
    that does nothing: "skip the queue" on a task that is not in one is a client
    that is looking at a stale row, and the honest answer is what makes it
    refetch. A task holding a HELD ANSWER is already at the head by definition
    (an answer outranks every message in its folder), so it is answered `ok` and
    nothing is written.

    **`{entry_id}` IS AN ALTERNATIVE TO `{key}`, and the chip in the chat sends
    it** (round-2 review, 2026-09-12). A task key is not a constant: a queued
    new chat is `pending:<leader entry>` until its leader's run mints a session,
    and then the whole row REKEYS onto that session. A Skip button holding the
    key it was painted with would, a second after the leader fired, name a row
    that no longer exists — a 404 on the one gesture the user is watching the
    line for. The entry id never moves, so the entry is what the chip names and
    the key is resolved here through the listing's own filing rule
    (`_entry_key`), which is the same answer the row was built under. The
    response is unchanged either way.

    """Run this WAITING message RIGHT NOW, beside whatever owns the folder.

    **IT IS THE FLAG-OFF BEHAVIOUR, FOR ONE MESSAGE** (Akshil, 2026-09-21).
    Skip next door is a statement about the ORDER of the line and leaves the
    queue deciding WHEN the turn goes; this is the user saying the line is not
    what they want for this one message. So the manager never owns it: the item
    leaves its line and the message is dispatched exactly as it would have been
    with `project_queue_enabled` off — two processes in one tree, which is what
    main has always done and what this pref exists to stop doing BY DEFAULT.

    **IT NEVER INTERRUPTS THE OWNER.** Nothing in this app takes a folder off a
    live process and this is not the exception: the holder keeps the folder and
    keeps running. "Force" is a statement about the QUEUE, never about the other
    run.

    **EVERY WAITING ROW GETS IT, INCLUDING #1.** "Next" and "now" are different
    promises — the task at the head of a line is still waiting on a turn that
    may have an hour left in it — so this is offered wherever a message is
    queued, unlike `skip`, which has nothing to say at position 1.

    `{entry_id}` OR `{key}`, resolved the way skip resolves them: a queued new
    chat is filed under `pending:<leader entry>` until its leader's run mints a
    session and the whole row then REKEYS, so the entry id is the only name a
    chip painted a second ago can safely hold (see `api_queue_skip`).

    **AND IT IS THE TASK'S FOR EVER, NOT THE MESSAGE'S** (Akshil, 2026-09-21:
    "once a task is force-started it never enters the queue again — no matter
    if it is blocked or has multiple messages"). The conversation is marked
    forced (`queue_manager.mark_forced`) under every name it answers to BEFORE
    anything is dispatched, and from then on the admission answers `run: true`,
    the run gate lets its sends through, its card decisions go straight to the
    agent and `reconcile` keeps its messages out of every line. Its remaining
    waiting messages leave the line with it and are dispatched, in order, by
    the scheduler's own tick — the flag-off branch (`schedule._tick_queued`),
    which is where this verb has always sent one message.

    Three answers, all of them 200:

    * `{"ok": true, "started": true, "run_id", "session_id"}` — it went.
    * `{"ok": true, "started": false, "reason": "already started"}` — there was
      nothing left to dispatch by the time this call reached the entry: it was
      cancelled, or the pump claimed it in the window. A 200, because the thing
      the user asked for either happened without them or is no longer theirs to
      ask for, and the next listing says which.
    * `{"ok": true, "started": false, "reason": <the scheduler's sentence>}` for
      a conversation that cannot take the message YET (`schedule.SpawnBusy` — a
      send already in flight, a live turn the user is typing into). **NOTHING
      GOES BACK IN THE LINE** (Bugbot, 2026-09-21): the task is forced, its
      entries are still `pending` in the store, and the next tick sends them
      down the same flag-off road. A 409 that re-enqueued would have been this
      verb undoing itself and handing the user back a place in a line they had
      just left.

    **A TASK WHOSE ONLY WAITING THING IS AN ANSWER** is not a message to
    dispatch — it is a held card decision, and "run it now" means DELIVER it,
    which is the same flag-off road (`_queue_deliver` → `agent._decide`, every
    rule applied against the run as it now is). The task owns nothing here, so
    `remove` only clears its line and its answers. A task that has BOTH is
    delivered AND dispatched, the decision first: `forget_entry` drops a task's
    held answers once it stands nowhere, so reading them after the entries had
    gone would have lost them (Bugbot, 2026-09-21).

    The same body the chat's own `decide` action takes, plus the `session_id` and
    `project` this needs to find the line. Two answers:

    * `{"held": false, ...}` — the decision went STRAIGHT THROUGH to
      `agent._decide` and the rest of the object is its ordinary result. This is
      what happens with the flag off, when the folder is free (or held by this
      very session), and when the run is already dead — a dead run's answer is
      recorded as `expired` by `_decide` itself, and holding it would park a
      decision for a process that can never read it.
    * `{"held": true, ...}` — the folder is busy with ANOTHER task, so the answer
      is stored in the manager's index and delivered when the folder frees.
      Nothing is written to the run's perm directory yet, which is the point: a
      parked run given its answer now would wake up and start editing a working
      tree another task owns — the exact collision the feature exists to
      prevent, arriving through the one door that is not a message.

    **WHICH OF THE TWO IS THE MANAGER'S ANSWER, NOT THIS ENDPOINT'S** (PR 2,
    2026-09-17). `card_answered` is one call under one lock: it knows who owns
    the folder, so "free, or this very task" and "somebody else has it" are
    decided where the owner is recorded rather than re-derived here against a
    scan that may already have moved. Held also puts the task at index 0,
    promoted — an answered card is the very next thing its folder does, until a
    later Run next says otherwise.

    **WHAT IS HELD IS THE ARGUMENTS, NOT A DECISION PAYLOAD** (deviation from the
    design doc, 2026-09-12, and noted there for the deliverer). The obvious store
    is the dict `_decide` would have written, and it is wrong: building it means
    re-implementing every rule in `_decide` — the narrow-never-widen scope
    downgrade, the mode switch, the keep-planning message, the answer validation
    against the parked request's own questions — in a second place, where they
    would drift. Worse, those rules read the LIVE run (`_alive`, the request
    file), and the answer is being made now and applied later: a scope computed
    against today's card and written after the run moved on would be a grant
    nobody checked. So `payload` is `{"raw": {...the decide arguments...}}` and
    the deliverer calls `agent._decide(**raw)` at delivery time, when every one of
    those rules is evaluated against the run as it then is (`_queue_deliver`).
    The first-writer-wins latch on disk (`_write_decision`) is unchanged.

    Position is 1 in the ordinary case — a held answer goes to the head of its
    folder's line — but it is READ BACK rather than promised: a Run next pressed
    on something else in the same second outranks it (rule 5, 2026-09-16), and
    the number the card prints has to be the one the row is about to print.

    **THE TWO IDS ARE CHECKED BEFORE ANYTHING IS STORED** (round-2 review,
    2026-09-12). Both become a path, and not here: the run id is joined onto
    `agent.RUNS` and the request id is joined with `.res.json` under the perm
    directory — by the pump that delivers the answer, minutes later and with
    nothing left to say where the string came from. `agent._decide` has always
    refused them (`_bad_id`), so the straight-through arm was covered; the HELD
    arm writes them into the index first and lets the rule be applied by whoever
    reads it back. So the rule is applied here, to both arms.

    **A CARD THAT ALREADY HAS A VERDICT IS DELIVERED, NEVER HELD.** See
    `_already_decided`: holding a second answer to a question that is already
    answered parks a decision nothing will ever act on and tells the tab that
    sent it that it is next in line.

    **A RUN WITH NO SESSION IS DELIVERED, NEVER HELD.** A held record is keyed
    by `session_id` — it is how the delivery finds the row, how the chip finds
    the position and how Skip recognises the head of the line — so an empty one
    parks a decision no view can reach and rings `notify(None)`, which wakes
    every poller about nothing. A run with no session cannot be queued behind
    anything anyway, and delivering it now is the honest fallback: the decision
    goes where the user meant it to go.
