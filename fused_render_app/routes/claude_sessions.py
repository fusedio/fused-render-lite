"""Claude Code session transcripts, read off disk for the Explorer.

Three endpoints, same on-disk source (~/.claude/projects/<encoded-cwd>/*.jsonl):

* ``GET /api/claude-sessions`` — one row per real project *folder*, for the
  exhaustive folder listing.
* ``GET /api/claude-sessions/home`` — the newest project folders for Home. It
  orders candidates by transcript mtime first, then opens at most one transcript
  per project directory and stops as soon as Home's single row is full.
* ``GET /api/claude-sessions/summaries`` — one row per *session*, for the
  React shell's Schedule page. The rules came from the retired bundled
  sessions inbox app this router replaced: same 45s "running" rule, same
  housekeeping-aware activity read, same session_names.json / triage.json
  overlays.

GET /api/claude-sessions — Claude Code project folders, for the Explorer
homepage's "Claude sessions" tab.

Scans transcripts at ~/.claude/projects/<encoded-cwd>/*.jsonl (Claude Code's
own on-disk session store) and groups them by the REAL project folder: the
`cwd` field recorded inside each transcript, not the encoded directory name.
That encoding is lossy — Claude Code turns every path separator AND every
literal hyphen in the original path into "-" — so a project path containing a hyphen would decode to
garbage. Reading `cwd` back out of the transcript is the only reliable way to
recover the folder.

One row per folder, newest session first. Folders that no longer exist on
disk are dropped rather than listed — the point of this tab is "open it", and
a folder that isn't there can't be opened.

    would add a phantom conversation to the very session list the feature is
    for. `--tools ""` denies the built-in set — there is nothing to do here but
    read the text in the prompt, and a recap that went off and ran `git log`
    would be both slow and a side effect. `--max-turns 1` stops it trying twice.

    never as an argv element — same rule as every other prompt this template
    sends (`_write_inbox_entry`, `ai.py`'s `_ai_cmd`), and load-bearing here
    for a reason unique to this one caller: a transcript tail is the only
    prompt in the app built out of the CONVERSATION rather than typed by a
    person, so it is the one guaranteed to contain embedded newlines. On the
    Windows `.bat`/`.cmd` shim an npm install of the CLI commonly resolves to,
    CreateProcess reroutes the whole argv through `cmd.exe /c`, which reads
    its command line ONE LINE AT A TIME — a raw newline inside a quoted argv
    string ends that line as far as cmd.exe is concerned, silently
    truncating the prompt at the first turn break no matter how it was
    quoted. Passed over stdin instead, the tail never touches the command
    line cmd.exe parses, on any platform.

    `--output-format stream-json` is not a choice: the CLI rejects
    `--input-format stream-json` paired with anything else
    ("--input-format=stream-json requires output-format=stream-json"), so the
    single-JSON-object reply `--output-format json` gave us is gone too —
    `_recap_result` reads the terminal `result` event back out of the
    line-per-event stream instead. `--verbose` rides along because the CLI
    requires it whenever `--output-format stream-json` is used (exits 1
    without it, same rule `ai.py`'s `_ai_cmd` documents).

    `cwd` is the target's own working directory when there is one, and a temp
    directory otherwise. It genuinely does not matter — a fresh session with no
    tools cannot look at the filesystem — but a cwd that does not exist fails
    the spawn itself, so the fallback is not optional.

    recap of yesterday's turn being shown over today's. Allowing it to be empty

    """`(mtime, size, running)` for ONE transcript file — the cheapest possible
    "has this conversation moved, and is it moving right now?" (D415).

    **Who asks.** The claude chat template, on the lap of its live watch, for a
    session it is showing but has no run of. A turn driven from OUTSIDE this app
    — an interactive `claude` in a terminal, a `claude --resume`, an agent
    someone else is running against the same session — creates no run dir, so
    `live_run` is blind to it by construction, and the chat sat showing a
    conversation that had moved on until the reader reloaded the page by hand.

    **Why a stat and not a read.** The page does not need the rows: it already
    has a renderer for the whole transcript (`history`), and re-rendering that is
    both correct and cheap. What it lacked was a reason to. `(mtime, size)` is
    that reason, at one `os.stat` per lap — the PAIR rather than mtime alone,
    because a coarse filesystem clock can put two appends in one tick where the
    size cannot repeat.

    **Why the PATH is the parameter.** Resolving a session id to a transcript is
    the one thing this endpoint must not decide: with copied files the same id
    exists in several project dirs with divergent content, and the chat resolves
    it against the folder it is open on (`agent.py`'s `_history`, which now hands
    the page the path it actually read). Globbing for the id here — what
    `session_liveness.transcript_path` does for the scheduler, which has no
    folder to go on — could answer about a different copy of the conversation
    than the one on screen. So the page passes back the path it was given, and
    this refuses anything outside the projects tree: it is a read of an arbitrary
    path otherwise, and "it is only a stat" is not an argument worth making.

    `running` is `session_liveness.transcript_turn_open` — the LAST MESSAGE in
    the file, not the 45s activity window the Inbox badge uses. The window is
    right for a badge and wrong here, and the measurement is the argument: a
    `claude --resume` driven from a terminal writes no `turn_duration` record
    when it finishes, so the window kept a shimmering "running" line under a
    reply that had already landed, for the balance of its 45 seconds. A chat
    showing the conversation is close enough to see that; a list of sessions is
    not. See that function for why two rules is the honest answer rather than a
    split brain.

    A transcript that is not there yet answers `exists: false` rather than 404:
    a chat can be open on a session whose first turn is still being written, and
    the watch's next lap is the natural place to notice that it now is."""
