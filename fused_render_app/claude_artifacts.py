"""Every Artifact this machine has published, recovered from Claude Code's own
session transcripts — the entry contract behind `GET /api/claude-artifacts`.

There is no artifacts index on disk to read. Publishing an Artifact is a tool
call inside a Claude Code session, and the only durable trace it leaves locally
is in the session transcript at ~/.claude/projects/<encoded-cwd>/<id>.jsonl.
Two kinds of line there matter, and BOTH are needed:

  * a top-level `{"type": "frame-link", ...}` record — one per successful
    publish, carrying the four facts that make an artifact addressable: the
    local `path` that was published, the hosted `frameUrl`, the `title`, and a
    `timestamp`. This is the authoritative publish record; if it isn't there,
    the publish didn't land, which is why an artifact with no frame-link is not
    listed at all.
  * the assistant's `tool_use` record for the Artifact call, which is the only
    place the `description` and `favicon` the author chose ever appear. The
    frame-link doesn't echo them back.

So the shape below is a JOIN, keyed on the local file path within a session,
between "what got published" and "how the author described it".

Identity is the `frameUrl`, not the file path. One page is redeployed many
times — a `.html` in a scratchpad gets published, edited, published again — and
every redeploy writes another frame-link for the SAME url. Those are one
artifact with a history, not N artifacts: latest publish wins for what to show
(title, path, description), `created_at` is the first publish and `updated_at`
the last. The dedupe also has to run ACROSS transcripts, because an artifact
can be updated from a different session later via the tool's `url` parameter —
a per-session merge alone would list that page twice.

Cost is the reason for the two-stage prefilter and the per-file cache. Real
transcript stores run to hundreds of megabytes; `json.loads` on every line of
that per request is not viable, and neither is re-reading unchanged files. So
lines are substring-screened before parsing (a cheap `in` test rejects
virtually all of them), and each transcript's merged result is cached against
its (mtime, size) so a repeat request only re-reads the transcripts that
actually moved.

Nothing in here raises for input it cannot read: an unreadable transcript, a
truncated JSON line, a timestamp in an unexpected format, a missing projects
dir — each degrades to "no artifacts from that", never to a failed listing.
`exists` is deliberately the one fact NOT cached: scratchpad files are
temporary and the caller needs to know, right now, whether the local source is
still openable.
