"""Which folder is this task editing, and what is that folder's runs tree doing?

Two `claude` processes editing one working tree is not parallelism, it is two
people typing into the same file. The rule the owner settled on (2026-09-12) is
one sentence: **one folder, one task in flight**; everything else that wants to
run in that folder queues. WHO OWNS A FOLDER AND WHAT ORDER THE LINE MOVES IN
ARE NOT HERE — they are `fused_render/queue_manager.py`, one event-driven index
with a single spawn site (PR 2, 2026-09-17). What is left here is the pair of
questions that index asks the disk, and neither of them is an opinion:

**The folder — `queue_key`.** A task names a `project` (a cwd) or a `target` (a
page file); both resolve to the working tree they edit: the app folder
(`current_apps.app_dir_for`) if the path is inside one, else the nearest
ancestor holding a `.git` — a directory OR a file, so a worktree keys on itself
and not on the repo it was cut from — else the folder itself. Never `$HOME` and
never `/`: those are not a project, they are the machine, and gating them would
serialise every unrelated task on the box behind one another. Memoized per path
(`KEY_CACHE_MAX`), because a listing asks it once per row.

**The runs tree — `scan_runs` and its readers.** One bounded, memoized walk of
the agent's run dirs (`RUN_SCAN_LIMIT`, `SCAN_TTL`) with the answers both of its
callers need already on each record: the session ids a run answers to
(`run_sessions`), its folder (`run_key`), its permission cards
(`run_permissions`), whether its process is alive (`run_alive`) and whether it
is parked on a card nobody has answered (`run_waiting`). The tasks router's
parked-run column and the queue manager's per-task `blocked` check are the two
readers, and they share the walk rather than each paying for one.

**Everything degrades to "nothing to report".** An unreadable run dir, a half
written `meta.json`, an agent module that will not load, a wedged mount — every
one of them costs that run its news and never raises, because the caller on the
other side is a chat send or a scheduler tick, and refusing to run a task
because a directory would not list is a worse failure than running two.

`read_legacy_held_answers` is the one backward-looking thing left: the old
`held_answers.json` store, read once so the manager can take over what a
previous version parked in it. Nothing writes it any more.

The whole behaviour sits behind `project_queue_enabled` (default off; see
`shell/prefs.py`). `enabled()` is read fresh per call so a toggle applies to the
very next send with no restart — the same no-restart discipline as the engine
preference.

    one directory queue against each other rather than running side by side.

    Three sources, in order:

    1. **The app folder** — `current_apps.app_dir_for`, so two tasks on two
       subfolders of one app share a key. This is the same rule the sidebar's
       Current apps section already uses to decide what is one app.
    2. **The nearest ancestor holding `.git`**, a directory *or a file*. The
       file case is what makes a git worktree its own key: `git worktree add`
       writes a `.git` FILE pointing back at the main repo, and a worktree is
       precisely the thing the user set up so two agents could run at once.
    3. **The folder itself**, for a project that is neither.

    `$HOME` and `/` are never keys and answer `""`. They are not a project, they
    are the machine: keying on them would put every unrelated task on the box in
    one line behind one another. `""` is also what an empty or relative input
    gets, and `""` is treated as "no folder" everywhere below — never held,
    always free.

    **Guarded before any syscall.** A project under a wedged network mount
    answers with its own path string and nothing is stat'd — `MountGuard.blocks`
    is pure string work against roots resolved once (see `_guard`). A chat send
    must not block for thirty seconds on a dead NFS server to find out which
    folder it is in.

    **Memoized per path**, because the answer is a property of the layout on
    disk and the callers ask it per task row per poll. That does mean a `.git`
    created after the first ask is not seen until `reset_cache()` — acceptable
    for a folder identity, and the reason tests that move `$HOME` or plant a

    has written one), and either can be the id a task row carries. Matching on

    **AND THE PID, WHICH IS THE THIRD SPELLING AND THE FASTEST ONE.** Both
    spellings above come from the run dir, and a brand-new chat's run dir names
    NEITHER for as long as nothing polls it: `resumed_from` is empty because
    there was nothing to resume, and the `session` file is written by the first

    (second message in a new chat answered `#1 in line · behind a run in this
    folder`, and the scheduler then started a SECOND `claude --resume` beside
    the chat's own idle host).

    folders are busy, and the tasks router, asking which runs are parked on a
    card. Newest-first is load-bearing for both — run ids lead with a timestamp,
    so the first answer for a session is its most recent run, and a resumed
    conversation with several runs in the tree is described by the one on screen.

    dead runs first, the parked scan throws out runs nobody is waiting on

    the flag-off cost this lazy slot exists to remove.

    `agent._bad_id`'s rule, spelled a second time for the same reason the

    outside the package's import graph, so the server cannot import the one it
    has. Empty, a leading dot, or a `/`, a backslash or a `:` — the last two
    because on Windows a backslash separates exactly like `/`, and a drive
    prefix ("d:x") makes `os.path.join` drop our directory altogether.

    Held HERE and not only at the endpoint because these two ids become a path
    twice over: the run id joins `agent.RUNS` and the request id is joined with
    `.res.json` under the perm directory when a held answer is finally
    delivered (`queue_manager.deliver`). A store that accepted `../../x` would
    be a path traversal written by one request and walked by a scheduler tick
    minutes later, where nothing is left to say where it came from (round-2
    review, 2026-09-12).
