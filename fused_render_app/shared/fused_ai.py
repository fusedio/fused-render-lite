"""A Python client for the local fused-render AI API (SPEC PY-19, D470-D472).

Mirrors `fused.ai` from `fused_render/static/runtime.js` — same names, same
option names, same closed-envelope rejection (D413) — for Python code that
wants local inference without re-implementing the model layer. See
`fused.ai.text/stream/transcribe/image/embed/models/cancel` there for the
JS-side contract this restates.

**Travels with `appenv.py`.** This module is stdlib only (`json`, `os`,
`socket`, `time`, `urllib`) and MUST NOT `import fused_render` — a `.py` data
file runs in a subprocess with `PYTHONPATH` stripped and cannot see the
package (SPEC PY-15; `_child.py` has a dedicated diagnostic for exactly this
mistake). It imports its sibling `appenv.py` instead, which already knows the
env-var contract for the shell's home dir — re-deriving that here would be
the second copy that drifts. Vendoring this file for use outside a
fused-render page (SPEC PY-19's bootstrap, or a standalone copy) means
vendoring `appenv.py` beside it; neither is useful alone.

**Three ways to reach this module** (see `docs/PYTHON_CLIENT_DESIGN.md`):
a user `.py` under a running server gets `import fused_ai` for free — the
engine seeds its path onto `sys.path` (`_child.py` and `engine.py`'s
generated wrapper, in lockstep); an external process reads `server.json`
(written by `server.export_app_env`'s neighbours) and `sys.path.insert`s its
`shared` value before importing; an app wanting zero coupling vendors this
file plus `appenv.py`. There is no `pip install`-able package form — that
would drag fastapi/duckdb/pyarrow into a caller that wants a 300-line HTTP
shim.

**Blocking by default.** `transcribe`, `image`, and `models.load`/`download`
POST to a job-backed endpoint that answers immediately with a `jobId`, the
way a page's `await fused.ai.image(...)` does — but a Python caller has a
thread to spend, so by default this module polls `GET /api/jobs` for that id
until it reaches a terminal state and returns the settled result. Pass
`wait=False` for the immediate reply (`{"jobId": ..., "path": ..., ...}`) to
drive the loop yourself, and `on_progress=` to observe each polled row. That
is the one place this surface deliberately differs from the JS one: `await`
becomes `return`.

**The request envelope is closed (D413) and this module does not re-check
it.** An option the server does not recognise comes back as a 400 from the
server itself — keeping a third copy of the whitelist here (beside
`runtime.js`'s and the server's own `_IMAGE_OPTIONS`/`_TRANSCRIBE_OPTIONS`/
`_EMBED_OPTIONS`) is exactly how the three would drift. The
`_IMAGE_WIRE_KEYS`/`_TRANSCRIBE_WIRE_KEYS`/`_EMBED_WIRE_KEYS` sets below
exist ONLY so a test can pin them against the server's own constants — they
name what this module forwards, not a gate it enforces.

    **`paths` and `kind` are refused PER MODEL, not per endpoint** (SPEC §40),
    and both refusals are the server's own `bad_request` naming the model:

    * `paths` needs a vision tower. A dual encoder (SigLIP, CLIP) has one and
      embeds pictures into the same space as its text, so a phrase can rank
      photographs; a prose encoder has one tower and refuses.
    * `kind` — `"query"` or `"document"` — needs a retrieval convention. A
      retrieval encoder instructs a question differently from a passage, and
      passing the wrong side is measurably worse than passing neither; a dual
      encoder has no such convention and refuses the field rather than
      accepting a parameter that would change nothing.

    Omitted means `"document"`, which is the internally-consistent default:
    every text in a corpus carries the same prefix, which is the symmetric
    behaviour every one of these models supports. Embed a corpus as documents
    once and each search as a query to get the asymmetric pair's full benefit.

    `kind` is passed through only when given, for the same reason `model` is:
    the server treats an absent key as "I did not say", and sending an explicit
    default would turn a legal call on a dual encoder into a 400.
