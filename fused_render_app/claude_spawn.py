"""Starting a detached Claude Code session FROM THE SERVER PROCESS.

Two features now do this — the apps API's scaffolding turn
(`server/routers/apps.py`) and scheduled messages (`schedule.py`) — and both
have to know the same three awkward things: that `agent._start` cannot be
called in this process at all, where the agent backend lives, and that a run
nobody polls never gets its finished turn committed. That is why this module exists rather
than a second copy of the comment block below: the fork-safety reasoning is the
kind that gets paraphrased into something false on the second telling.

No import of anything under `fused_render.server` — `schedule.py` imports this
and the routers import both; keep it acyclic. The one thing that would tempt
such an import is the agent's path, and `core_templates` is where that actually
comes from (`server.templates.TEMPLATES_DIR` *is* `ensure_core_templates()`),
so asking it directly costs nothing and keeps the layering straight.

# The helper the spawn runs in. agent._start cannot be called in THIS process:
# its Popen sets cwd + start_new_session, which forces CPython off posix_spawn
# onto fork()+exec, and the server has libproj resident with a live proj.db
# SQLite handle — fork() runs PROJ's pthread_atfork child handler, which
# sqlite3_close()es that now-invalid handle and SIGSEGVs the child before exec
# (the exact crash test_worker_forksafe.py locks out of the executor; verified
# live: empty out.jsonl, dead pid, a Python .ips crash report with the server
# as parent). So the _start happens one hop away, in a bare python that has no
# libproj loaded and can fork freely. Args ride over stdin as JSON (never
# argv — the prompt is user text); the result comes back as one JSON line.
#
# `session_id` rides through as a real parameter because a scheduled message may
# target an EXISTING conversation ("" is a fresh one, which is all the apps API
# ever wants). model/effort ride through the same way now that the /apps hero
# composer has a picker for them: empty means "no --model/--effort flag
# at all", which is what leaves the session on the same defaults a chat opened
# by hand would detect for itself. `.get` and not `[...]`: the request dict is
# built by whichever caller ran, and the ones with no picker send neither key.
