"""Carry an app folder's Claude sessions along when the folder is moved.

Claude Code keys its session store by working directory: a session run in
`/A/app` lives at `~/.claude/projects/-A-app/<id>.jsonl` (every non-alphanumeric
character of the cwd becomes `-`), and `claude --resume <id>` looks only in the
bucket for the cwd it is started from. Move `/A/app` to `/B/app` and every
conversation about the app is still on disk and unreachable from the app: the
Tasks list is empty, "continue in terminal" finds nothing, resume fails.

`relocate(old_root, new_root)` moves every transcript whose recorded cwd is
`old_root` or a directory under it into the bucket for the corresponding path
under `new_root`, rewriting the `cwd` field on the way so the readers that
trust it (routers/claude_sessions.py, the Home row) see the new path, and
carries each transcript's side directory (`<id>/`, tool results) with it. The
caller is `app_fused_dir._ensure_meta`, at the one moment the move is known:
the `.fused/meta.json` witness disagreeing with the live path (D548, SPEC §47).

What decides membership is the TRANSCRIPT'S OWN `cwd` LINE, never the bucket
name. The bucket name is a lossy encoding — `-A-app-` prefixes the bucket for
`/A/app-old` (a sibling that did not move) as well as `/A/app/sub` — and one
bucket can hold transcripts from two cwds that collide under the munge. So the
bucket names are only used to shortlist directories worth opening; each file
is then read for its first `cwd` and moved only when that cwd is under
`old_root`. A transcript with no `cwd` line at all is not a match and not a
blocker: it belongs to nothing we can name.

A transcript is left where it is when the session is RUNNING — a process is
appending to that path and moving it from under it would split the
conversation. Running is either a live entry in `~/.claude/sessions/` (pid
checked, those files go stale) or `session_liveness.transcript_turn_open` saying
a turn is in flight. Those count as `pending`, and `complete` is False, so the
caller leaves the witness in place and the next open tries again.

When the destination already has a transcript of the same id, the destination
wins and the source is left alone (not pending): a copy-on-resume has already
carried it, and the live continuation is the one at the new path. A source that
vanishes mid-run (a concurrent relocate got there first) is done, not failed.

Deliberately NOT touched: the `projects` map in `~/.claude.json` (the CLI owns
that file — claude_config/mcp.py), `~/.claude/history.jsonl` (cosmetic prompt
history), and `file-history/` / `todos/` (keyed by session id, so a cwd move
does not affect them). A bucket's `memory/` folder and any other unknown entry
move only when the destination has no file of that name; nothing is ever
overwritten.

Best-effort, like everything on the render path: nothing here raises. The
roots are module attributes resolved at call time so tests can point them at a
temp tree instead of the machine's real store.
