"""Task numbers and unread marks — the two global stores behind the Tasks page.

A **task is a Claude Code session**, 1:1, and the session store is Claude Code's,
not ours. So neither of the facts this module keeps can live inside a transcript:
a transcript has no room for "this is TASK-003 of ~/Desktop/fused", and it
certainly has no room for "the human has read this message". Both are ours, both
are keyed by session, and both therefore live here.

**Global, deliberately — not branch-scoped.** `storage.home_dir()` nests state
under the checkout's branch so a dev branch cannot fire the baseline install's
schedule. Sessions are the other kind of thing: `~/.claude/projects` is one pool
for the whole machine, so a task numbered from a worktree must keep that number
when the same session is read from main. This mirrors exactly what
`server/routers/claude_sessions.py` does with `session_names.json` /
`triage.json`, and uses the same directory as those, for the same reason.

## `task_ids.json` — allocate once, never renumber

    {"<session-id-or-pending-key>": {"project": "/Users/…/fused", "n": 3}}

Numbers restart at 1 **per project** (a project is a folder — see §2 of the
design; a task on `~/x/foo.py` is a task in `~/x`), and allocation is
"max n seen for this project, plus one", read and written under one lock. That
rule is the whole point: TASK-002 does not become TASK-001 when TASK-001 is
deleted. A number the user has seen, quoted in a note, or typed into a message
must keep meaning the same thing, and a compacting scheme buys tidiness by
breaking that. Gaps are the price and they are the correct price.

**A draft is the one row whose project can still change**, and it is the one
exception this rule needs. The New task modal numbers what you are typing at the
first keystroke, in whatever folder the form is pointed at THEN — and then the
person changes the folder. Allocate-once let the number ride along, so a project
counting TASK-001…015 showed a TASK-202 borrowed from the project the draft was
started in (Akshil, 2026-09-11). Nothing had been promised: a draft is not a
task yet, nobody has quoted its number in a note, and the number it shows is a
claim about which project it belongs to. So `ensure_ids(…, reproject=True)`
drops the mapping of a draft whose project has moved and allocates afresh in the
project it NOW points at. The old number is SPENT, never released (`_spend`) —
a gap in the old project, which is the same price every delete above pays. The
moment the draft becomes a real task (`rekey` onto `pending:<entry-id>`) the
number is fixed like every other, because from there on it is one the user has
been shown as booked.

A task that exists before its session does (§5: a message scheduled for
tomorrow has nothing to run in yet) is keyed `pending:<entry-id>` and gets its
number then. `rekey` moves that number onto the session id at the first run, so
the row the user has been watching keeps its name instead of being renumbered
the moment it finally does something.

## `read.json` — unread, per message

    {"__initialized_at__": 1755300000.0,
     "<session-id>": {"last_read_at": 1755300000.0,
                      "read_ids": ["MSG-003"], "read_floor": 0}}

**Why an explicit id set and not a watermark.** A watermark ("everything up to
MSG-003 is read") cannot express the thing the design actually asks for: unread
is tracked *per message*, and clicking MSG-003 marks MSG-003 read — not MSG-002,
which the user skipped past and still means to read. A watermark alone would
mark it read as a side effect, and silently losing a notification is the one
failure this feature exists to prevent.

The set's cost is that it grows without bound, so `read_floor` is a watermark
used **only as a compaction floor**: once the set covers a contiguous run from
MSG-001, that run collapses into the floor and leaves the set. Every id at or
below the floor is implicitly read, so the common case (a user who reads a
thread through) stores one integer instead of a thousand strings, and the
sparse case (read 3, skipped 2) keeps the exact truth it needs. `last_read_at`
is the wall clock of the most recent mark; it is not consulted when deciding
whether a message is read — reading it as a floor would reintroduce the bug the
set exists to avoid.

**Marking a WHOLE task read** (the List row's own button) is not a second
mechanism and did not need one. It is `mark_read_many` with every message the
thread holds — one lock and one write for a thread of 89, where clicking through
was 89 of each — and the compaction above is what turns it into the watermark it
should be: a contiguous run from MSG-001 folds into `read_floor` and the id list
comes out empty, which is precisely "everything in this task is read", stored as
one integer. The caller passes the ids; the mark still reaches nowhere on its
own, so the invariant one message carries is the invariant the batch carries.

**Day one.** A store that has never existed would otherwise say every message
ever written is unread — on a real machine that was 1,946 unread across 174 of
192 tasks, a badge on everything and therefore a badge that means nothing.
Unread has to mean "arrived since I started using this", so `initialize` stamps
each existing task's floor at its current message count exactly once, under the
`__initialized_at__` guard. Same mechanism as the compaction floor above, set at
the start rather than accumulated — and per task, not one global clock, so a
task that appears LATER still has its first message land unread.

Nothing here raises for input it cannot read: a missing store, a corrupt store,
a record of the wrong shape, a transcript that vanished mid-walk — each degrades
to "no number/no marks yet", never to a failed listing. Same posture as every
other registry in this package.

No import of anything under `fused_render.server`: `server/app.py` imports the
tasks router, the router imports this module. Keeping that one-way means the
constants below are duplicated from `claude_sessions.py` rather than imported —
the same deliberate local duplication `claude_artifacts.py` makes of the same
two lines.

# WHICH CLAUDE A CONVERSATION RUNS WITH, and how hard it thinks — the fourth
# fact about a task that cannot live in a transcript, after its number, its read
# marks and its tombstone, and it lives here for the same reasons: keyed by
# session, global, never branch-nested.
#
# WHY OURS AND NOT THE TRANSCRIPT'S. The composer used to DETECT both by reading
# Claude Code's transcripts: the model off `message.model`, which every
# assistant row carries, and the effort off a top-level `effort` key, which
# Claude Code writes only sometimes. A field the writer does not reliably write
# is a field that reads as missing, and a missing field used to be filled in
# from the newest OTHER chat in the same folder — so a task set up with
# haiku/low opened on some neighbour's max (Akshil, 2026-09-18: "made a task
# with haiku/low; peek first showed fable/max"). Detection also cannot answer
# at all in the seconds between "this conversation has an id" and "this
# conversation has a transcript", which is exactly when a new task's peek is
# first read.
#
# So the app records what it launched a run with, and what the reader picked,
# at the moment it knows — `agent._start` and `_send` for every spawn and every
# send, `POST /api/tasks/settings` for every pill pick — and every surface reads
# THAT. Transcript scanning stays as the legacy fallback for conversations that
# predate this store.
#
# PER FIELD, and a missing one stays missing. `record` writes only what it was
# given, so a pick that names the effort cannot wipe a model recorded at spawn.
# Nothing here ever answers about a DIFFERENT session: a field this store has
# no value for reads as "", the caller's own constant default speaks, and the
# reader is never told about a conversation they did not ask about.
#
# A record for a session whose transcript is later erased goes with it
# (`forget_session`) — there is no conversation left for it to be about.

# and the disagreement was visible to the user in two opposite ways at once:
# rows in the Tasks list titled `<live-app-state>` and
# `<command-message>making-a-release</command-message>`, and — worse — real
# messages missing from the app because a reader dropped the whole record on
# sight of a leading tag.
#
# Two sources write these records, and that is the whole reason for the split
# below. Claude Code writes some ON the user's behalf: a finished subagent
# reporting back, a slash command's envelope, the stdout it captured. The
# fused-render Claude page writes others IN FRONT OF what the user typed
# (`composeOutgoing` in templates/claude/template.html: the app-state snapshot,
# then the pane screenshots, then the annotation notes, then the words).
#
# The corpus says the two groups behave OPPOSITELY. Over 219 transcripts / 2519
# user records with text, on one real machine (2026-08-17), counting records
# whose FIRST block is the tag and asking whether any prose survives the strip:
#
#     leading tag                records   carry prose
#     <task-notification>            889   0
#     <command-name>                  77   0      \  one envelope, three blocks,

#     <bash-input>                     5   0      \  one envelope again: input,
#     <bash-stdout>                    5   0       > then its two output halves

#     line INSIDE a note so that boundary is unambiguous (the composer commits
#     on Enter and takes a newline on Shift+Enter, so a note really can hold
#     one);
#   * the FIRST paragraph is the block's own preamble, and it is the only one
#     that does not open with `**A** — ` (every stanza opens with its label);
#   * inside a stanza the first line is that heading, the no-badge caveat and
#     the no-words placeholder are OURS, and what is left is what the user said.
#
# The two machine lines are matched EXACTLY rather than as "any wholly-italic
# line": a note that is one emphasised word is a note, and dropping it as prose
# of ours loses the row's whole name.
#
# Anything that does not match is answered "" rather than guessed at — a row
# named with a fragment of our own preamble is worse than one named by its id.

# `frontend/src/apps/claude/protocol/wire.ts` substitutes one MARKER per block
# kind for the bubble's text — and until 2026-09-18 every Python reader answered
# such a record "" and DROPPED it, which cost the whole chat its rows on the
# Tasks page (both real sends in one reported annotation session) and, via
# `tasks.py::_status`, its status too: status is derived from the messages, so no
# messages meant nothing to derive from and the run read `done` while it ran.
#
# THE WORDS ARE THE CLIENT'S, NOT OURS. A fourth spelling of "screenshot" would
# be a fourth thing to keep in step, so these are `MARKER_VIEW`/`MARKER_IMG`/
# `MARKER_FILE`/`MARKER_ANN` — pinned to the page's own copy by
# `tests/test_tasks_store.py` (D146: the duplicated rule gets a test, not a
# comment).
#

# because the page needs to tell its own substitute text apart from a reader who
# genuinely typed "files"; that sigil is a private token of the page's display
# layer and is never put on the wire. What a bubble SHOWS is `markerWord`'s

    screenshot of the pane in it — including a block too old or too broken to
    carry `kind` — is `pane screenshot`. That last default is the page's too,

    removed. The mtime moves; nobody typed anything. Answering off the mtime
    alone brought every erased chat back ~30 s later as a blank done row.

    line that straddles each seek point joined once from the pieces either side

    recreate this whole fix is about, and gluing non-adjacent bytes into one
