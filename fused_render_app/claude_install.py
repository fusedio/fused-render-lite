"""Running the Claude Code installer, and `claude update`, on the user's behalf.

`claude_health.py` is the other half of this and came first: it establishes what
is wrong with Claude Code on this machine, carefully and without ever guessing.
Every one of its findings then ended the same way — a sentence telling the user
to open a terminal and type something. On a machine where the app was launched
from the Dock, that is the app knowing the answer and asking the user to go and
apply it somewhere else.

This module applies two of them.

**Why a module and not two `subprocess.run` calls in a route.** Both actions are
minutes long, both replace a binary the rest of the app spawns, and both have a
failure surface that is the whole point of running them (a 403 from
downloads.claude.ai and a proxy blocking TLS are different problems with
different fixes, and a generic "install failed" throws both away). So they need
progress, a verbatim error, single-flight, and a re-probe on success. That is a
state machine, not a call.

**One record, two actions.** `install` and `update` differ only in the command
line: they are both "run something that changes the CLI on disk, then re-measure
health". Keeping one record means the UI has one thing to poll and there is one
place where "is something already running?" is answered.

**A thread, not a detached worker.** `envinstall.py` detaches, because a `uv
sync` can run for many minutes and must survive the page that started it. This
is shorter and, more importantly, its whole value is the re-probe at the end —
which has to happen in the server process, because that is where the health
cache and the `FUSED_RENDER_CLAUDE_BIN` adoption live. A detached child would
finish and have nobody to tell.

It reports into `jobs.py` as well, so the work stays visible in the download
manager after the user navigates away from the strip that started it.

    other one would leave the app on the old version reporting success.

    THROUGH `_probe_cmd`, WHICH IS NOT A DETAIL ON WINDOWS. npm installs `claude`
    as a `.cmd` shim, which `CreateProcess` cannot run — only cmd.exe can — and
    npm is one of the two methods `update_plan` calls self-updating, so this is
    precisely the install type the Update button is offered for. Spawning the
    shim as a raw argv list raises OSError on every Windows npm install, i.e.
    the button would be broken for the users it exists to serve. `claude_health`
    already solved this for its own probes; reusing it is what keeps the spawn
    and the probe agreeing about how to start the same file.

    So `cmd` is an argv LIST normally and one command STRING behind a shim; the
