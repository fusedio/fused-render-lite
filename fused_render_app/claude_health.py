"""Whether Claude Code is usable on this machine — asked BEFORE anything needs it.

Every Claude failure in this app used to be discovered the same way: the user
did something, it failed, and a card explained the failure afterwards (SPEC §42
handles that part well). This module is the other half — the facts a first run
can be told *before* a prompt has been typed:

  * is the `claude` binary there, and where did we find it
  * is it new enough for the flag set `server/ai.py:_ai_cmd` spawns it with
  * is it signed in

The pattern is "tell the surface up front, so it's never a dead link".
Claude Code had no equivalent, so every Claude-dependent surface rendered
as available and found out otherwise on click.

**This module is the one place in the package that names an install directory.**
`server/ai.py` imports its candidate tuples from here rather than keeping a
second copy — that divergence is what let a CLI in `~/.bun/bin` produce a
working Claude-config tab and an `ai_unavailable` from `fused.ai()` on the same
machine, in the same second. `templates/claude/agent.py` keeps its own copy on
purpose (a template is standalone user-forkable code and may not import the app,
D166); `tests/test_claude_health.py` pins the two lists together so they cannot
drift silently.

**Nothing here raises.** Health is a report about the machine, and a report that
500s is worth less than one that says "I could not tell". Every probe degrades
to None/False and the caller still gets a whole answer.

    1. **Ask the CLI** (`claude auth status`). It is the only party that knows,

# Two questions the module never used to ask, both raised by the same finding:
# every state below was DETECTED and then handed to the user as a sentence to go
# and act on. Answering them is what lets the app act instead.

#: How the native installers spell their target, per platform. The app runs this
#: itself now (`claude_install.py`), so it is no longer only a thing to copy —
#: but it is still shown before it runs, and `test_trouble_parity.py` pins it,
#: because a wrong command in front of a user is worse than no command.
#:
#: The POSIX line is the one the download page and the chat template already
#: carry. THE WINDOWS LINE IS NEW, and its absence was a real bug: the strip
#: attached the bash line to every `missing` card regardless of platform, so a
#: Windows user with no Claude Code was handed a command their shell cannot run.

# --- the terminal's PATH, as opposed to ours ----------------------------------
#
# The app finding the CLI and the user's terminal finding it are different facts,
# and the native installer is why they diverge: `claude install` creates
# ~/.local/bin/claude and then only PRINTS the shell-profile line — it never
# edits an rc file. Worse, when the app runs the installer it does so with
# `augmented_path()` (claude_install._child_env), which already contains
# ~/.local/bin, so the installer sees the directory "on PATH" and prints no
# warning at all. The one messenger the user had is silenced by our own
# environment prep. So the app measures the fact itself and owns the repair.

#: Which rc file the PATH line belongs in, by shell. bash on macOS gets the
#: login-shell startup file it ALREADY reads (the first existing of
#: ~/.bash_profile, ~/.bash_login, ~/.profile — Terminal.app opens login
#: shells), and ~/.bashrc everywhere else; zsh gets $ZDOTDIR/.zshrc when
#: ZDOTDIR is set, plain ~/.zshrc otherwise. fish is deliberately absent: its
#: syntax is not `export`, and appending a bash line to fish config would
#: break the shell we were trying to fix — a fish user gets the fact reported

    but the two paths that actually start Claude Code (`server/ai.py:_claude_bin`
