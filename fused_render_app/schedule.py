"""Scheduled Claude messages: a durable list of "send this prompt to this
target at this time", plus the loop that sends them.

The app already knows how to start a detached Claude Code session from the
server process (`claude_spawn`). What it had no way to say was *later*. This
module is that word, and it is deliberately the whole of it: the schedule lives
here, the firing decision lives here, and the only thing the OS is asked for is
to have the app running (`schedule_wake`).

**Why the app owns the send rather than cron/launchd owning it.** An external
scheduler can run `claude -p` perfectly well — and would run it in a different
world. `supervisor/paths.py:child_environment` injects some twenty variables
into every child the app spawns (state dir, cache dirs, the bundled rclone and
uv, `TMPDIR`, and the `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` passthrough that a relocation once
broke), and `_plugin_argv` hands the session fused-render's skills only when
that env contract is present. A crontab line reproduces none of it, so the
scheduled turn silently becomes a different install: other state dir, no
skills. On macOS it is worse than different — D72's TCC finding is that a
process which is not the app does not inherit the app's Documents/Desktop
grants, so a cron-launched turn touching ~/Documents raises a consent prompt
with nobody present to answer it, and the credentials it needs live in the login
Keychain of a GUI session it is not in. Firing from inside the server process
makes a scheduled turn environmentally identical to one the user typed.

**What that costs, stated plainly: nothing fires while the app is not running.**
That is the trade this design accepts, and the two mechanisms below are what
make it survivable rather than silent:

* **Wall-clock, not tick-counting.** Every tick asks "what is due *now*",
  comparing stored timestamps against the clock. Nothing counts elapsed ticks,
  so a laptop that slept through a due time fires on the tick after it wakes,
  and an app that was quit fires on the tick after it next starts. Catch-up
  is not a feature here; it is what the absence of tick-counting gets for free.
* **A QUEUE, rather than a bound on how late is still worth sending.** This is
  the part that changed, and the old reasoning is worth keeping visible because
  the new rule is an answer to it rather than a denial of it. The bound existed
  because unbounded catch-up is its own bug: a message meant for Tuesday's 9am
  standup, fired unattended on Friday afternoon against a repo that has moved
  on, is worse than one that never fired. The default was a day; past it an
  entry became `missed` — visible, never sent.

  What that got wrong is *who decides*. A day is a guess about the user's
  habits made by a constant, and the user was never asked. So the decision moved
  to them: missed work is **queued** and runs when the app next opens, and the
  queue is a surface with cancel-each and cancel-all on it (`queue`,
  `cancel_queued`, and the popover the shell raises from them). Silently
  discarding a message is no longer something this module does on its own.

  Three rules make that safe rather than reckless, and each is load-bearing:

  1. **One-offs are unbounded, because an unsent one-shot is GONE.** Ten
     one-offs missed over two weeks all fire on open. `max_late_seconds()`
     therefore answers `None` by default — no bound. An operator who sets
     `FUSED_RENDER_SCHEDULE_MAX_LATE` explicitly still gets one, and it still
     produces `missed` exactly as before; the env var is the escape hatch for
     an install that wants the old shape.
  2. **Recurring occurrences COALESCE — only the latest missed run is sent**
     (`_coalesce`). The surviving half of the old 120-second occurrence bound:
     replaying a week of "daily at 9am" into one thread is not what the words
     meant, and the next run is already coming. The dropped runs are counted
     and reported on the survivor (`skipped`, `skipped_note`) rather than
     vanishing.
  3. **Scheduling into the past is allowed** and is recorded with the due time
     the user picked, so history reads truthfully. Because the queue runs in
     due order, a due time in the past sorts ahead of everything later — it is
     at the head of the queue and goes on the next tick. **A REPEAT anchored in
     the past reads the same way**: the LATEST slot at or before now is
     materialized once and goes immediately, the slots before it never happen,
     and the series then continues from now (`_catch_up_base`). That is rule (2)
     arrived at from the other side, and it is literally the same walk.

  Nothing here counts ticks either: coalescing walks the recurrence with
  wall-clock arithmetic, asking "which occurrences lie between this entry's due
  time and now", and never "how many ticks did we miss".

**The claim-before-spawn order matters.** An entry is written `sending` BEFORE
the helper is spawned, not after. If the process dies mid-spawn the entry is
`sending`, not `pending`, so the next boot does not send it again — a stuck
entry that a sweep later reports as interrupted. That is the safe direction to
fail: an unsent message is a disappointment, a message sent five times over five
crash-restarts is an agent running unattended five times.

**Permission mode.** A scheduled turn has no page attached, so it inherits the
apps API's problem (see `_SCHEDULED_PERMISSION_MODE`) and its answer, with one
extra wrinkle: the apps API's session is one the user is about to look at, and
this one is by definition unattended. The mode is therefore per-entry and
recorded with the entry, so "auto" is a choice made per message rather than a
property of scheduling.

**Nobody is looking when any of this happens**, which is the premise of the
feature and therefore the premise of its reporting: a row on a page the user has
to think to visit is not how they should learn that last night's message failed.
Two surfaces close that, and the block above `_JOB_PREFIX` is where they are
explained — a live job row (what is it doing, including "parked on a permission
card") and an event log the shell toasts (what happened while I was away).

No import of anything under `fused_render.server` — the router imports this
module; keep it acyclic.

    `title` and `description` are the user's own words about the work, both
    optional and both stored as given. An empty `title` is not a missing value
    to be filled in here — it is the first branch of a precedence the tasks
    endpoint owns (the user's title, else Claude Code's `ai-title` off the
    transcript, else the message's first line), and guessing one at creation
    would pin the row to whatever the message happened to open with.

    The three of them are UNTYPED on purpose: the router hands this module the
    request body's values as they arrived, and the form omits a field rather
    than sending a blank one, so "absent", "null" and "" all have to mean the
    same thing. `_text` and `_flag` are where that happens.

    `new_task_each_run` only means anything on a repeating message, and it names
    the threading model: a task IS a Claude session, so by default every run of
    a repeating message appends to the same thread (the occurrence inherits the
    template's `session_id`). Ticked, each run starts a fresh session instead.
    See `_materialize`, which is where the one-line difference lives.

    A repeating message created WITHOUT a `session_id` — which is every one the
    Tasks page makes, and every one handed off from a chat, that form dropping
    the open conversation rather than letting a repeat compound it for ever —
    still chains: its first run opens a thread and `_chain_session` records
    which, so runs 2..N continue it.

    `session_learned` is the PROVENANCE of `session_id`, and this function
    never invents it. Two very different things put an id on an entry — a chat
    handoff (the conversation the user was in) and a thread the template LEARNED
    on its first run — and an edit, which is cancel + re-create, has to treat
    them oppositely: a repeat must refuse the former and keep the latter. Only
    `_chain_session` mints the marker; `create` accepts it so that an edit
    re-stating a learned id can say which kind it is, because the alternative
    was the form INFERRING it from whether the entry repeated, and that could
    not survive a task being demoted to a one-off and promoted back.

    `follow_of` is the same link one step down: the entry this message was
    typed BEHIND, for the one case where a chat has no session to name because
    its own first message is still queued. It must name an entry that exists
    (400 otherwise), and everything downstream — the Tasks row it is filed
    under, its place in the line, the session it resumes when it finally goes —
    reads the leader's answer through `leader_of`.

    `origin` is WHO ASKED FOR THIS MESSAGE, and it is "" for everything the
    calendar and the Tasks page create — which is what makes it readable the
    other way round: an entry with no origin is a message somebody SCHEDULED,
    and a chat with one of those aimed at it still shuts its composer until it
    goes, exactly as it did before the queue existed (Akshil, 2026-09-12).
    `"chat"` is written by the admission endpoint and by nothing else: a
    message the chat itself queued is that conversation's own next line, so the
    composer stays open and the waiting bubble says so under itself instead.

    Stored ONLY when non-empty, so an ordinary spawn's entry is main's field for
    field, and never invented downstream: `_materialize` mints an occurrence
    without one (a repeat is a schedule, whoever first typed it) and `restore`
    leaves alone what is there. `resend` is the exception that proves the rule —
    it copies the original's, because asking a chat's queued message again is
    still the chat's message.

    With `repeats` (a 5-field cron expression) the stored entry is a RECURRING
    template instead: `due` is ignored — the cron line already says every time
    it means — and the first occurrence is materialized immediately, so the
    wake stub knows about it before this returns.

    With `rule` (a structured repeat, see recur.py) the entry is also a
    RECURRING template, and the one difference from the cron case is that `due`
    is REQUIRED rather than ignored: a rule counts from an anchor, and the
    anchor is that first run. It is kept in its own field because `due` is
    rewritten on every materialization to mirror the next occurrence, and a
    series numbered from a moving anchor would renumber itself every tick.

    `create_target` opts the caller into ONE new folder: a target whose last
    segment does not exist yet is made here, provided its parent already does.
    The New task form offers this (it shows the path as a new folder while you
    type it), so the endpoint behind that form passes it; every other caller
    leaves it off and keeps the plain "no such file or directory" refusal. It is
    a flag rather than the default precisely because of the re-send path
    (`resend` below), where a target that has since been deleted is a fact the
    user needs told — silently re-making a deleted FILE's name as a directory
    would be the worst possible answer.

    Exactly one level, never `-p`: two missing segments means the user is not
    naming a new folder in a place they know, they are typing into a tree that
    is not there, and inventing both is how a typo becomes a real directory.

    The folder is CHECKED where the target is resolved and MADE at the very
    bottom, immediately before the entry is stored — so a request refused by a
    later validation (a cron line, a due date, a permission mode) leaves nothing
    on disk. Ordering rather than a rollback: an unlink after the fact could
    remove a directory something else had already raced into.

    Raises ValueError for everything a caller can get wrong (the router maps it
    to a 400). The one validation deliberately NOT here is "is this path
    mount-backed" — that needs the mounts registry, which lives above this
    module; the router refuses those before calling, exactly as the claude
    template's own gate does."""

    **The claim race is the whole design problem here**, and the answer is to
    refuse rather than to force. The tick claims an entry (`pending` ->
    `sending`) immediately before spawning its helper, so between the moment the
    user reads the queue and the moment they press Cancel, an entry can be away.
    Cancelling it then would be a claim this module cannot make good on — the
    process is launched, the turn may have started — and writing `cancelled`
    over `sending` would additionally destroy the record the stuck sweep needs
    to report an interrupted send.

    So the transition allowed is exactly `pending` -> `cancelled`, decided on a
    fresh read under `_lock` — the same lock and the same re-read `_claim` uses.
    One of the two wins and the other sees the loser's state: cancel first and
    the claim returns None (the tick skips it), claim first and cancel refuses
    it as already running. Neither can leave a half-cancelled entry.

    `all_queued` means the entries `queue()` would list right now, recomputed
    under the lock rather than trusted from the client — "cancel all" must mean
    the queue as it is, not the queue as the page last drew it, or a message
    that came due in between would be cancelled without ever being shown.

    next" is the queue manager's `skip` — it moves the task to index 0 of its
    folder's line, and newest press wins because the array says so. This writes
    the bool the Tasks page and the calendar draw a promoted row with, and
    nothing here decides what runs.

    **Only a PENDING entry can be skipped**, and every other state is refused
    rather than silently ignored. That is the same line `cancel_queued` draws
    and for the same reason: an entry the tick has already claimed is away, and
    moving it up the line it has left would be a promise about a message that
    is not in the line any more. A `sent`, `cancelled` or `missed` entry has no
    line to be at the head of at all.

    The write is flag-agnostic — the field is stored either way (see `create`)
    — and so is the ring, which is why this is safe to call with the project
    queue off: an entry marked priority that nothing reads is an entry in the
    order it was already in.

    **Rings both bells.** `wake()` because the head of a folder's line may have
    just changed and the loop is otherwise up to 30 seconds away from noticing;
    `tasks_watch.notify` because the Tasks page draws the position and a skip
    that takes a poll interval to appear reads as a button that did nothing.

    plain-text tail — "Attached files (read them with the Read tool):" and the
    paths, one per line — and it worked for the model and failed for the human:
    opening the fired task's chat showed the user's turn ending in a list of
    `/Users/…/task-shots/…pdf` temp paths, where the SAME chat renders its own
    attachments as receipt rows (a thumbnail, or 📄 and the file's name, both
    opening the viewer). Same files, two presentations, and the one the user
    could not read was the one they never chose.

    The block the chat writes is the block that renders. `template.html` reads
    it back on restore (`paneShotIn` → `shotRestoreReceipt`) and every reader of
    a transcript already strips it from a row title (`tasks_store`,
    `agent.py::_strip_machinery`, `sessionTitle`), because `pane-shot` has been
    in `_MACHINERY_STRIP` all along. Nothing new had to learn anything; the
    scheduler just had to stop inventing a shape.

    Paths, not pixels, exactly as before: the spawned run pre-allows Read of
    ``shots_dir()`` (`_send` passes it as an extra read dir), so the model opens
    the files itself and a repeat re-reads them on every run without the store
    carrying megabytes of base64.

    THE TAG AND THE PAYLOAD SHAPE ARE DUPLICATED, not imported: a template may
    not import fused_render and fused_render may not import a template (SPEC
    PY-15 / D166), so `_PANE_SHOT_TAG` is a second copy of the page's
    `PANE_SHOT_TAG` and the entries are hand-written to the shape `paneShotIn`
    parses. A parity test reads the page's constant out of template.html and
    compares (D146: the duplicated rule gets a test, not a comment).

    What the payload leaves out, and why that is safe: `viewNote` is "" (there
    is nothing this picture fails to show — nobody cropped it), and there is no
    `size` (the browser drew every picture it kept, or the upload endpoint
    transcoded it). `paneShotIn` reads whatever parses and every consumer treats
    a missing field as absent, so an entry is exactly `{kind, view, name,

    caller should spawn as it always did.

    **NEVER A SECOND PROCESS ON ONE CONVERSATION** (Akshil, 2026-09-12). A chat
    whose host is up and idle between turns is exactly the thing a scheduled
    message for that session used to start a `claude --resume` beside: two hosts
    on one session id, two writers on one transcript, in one working tree. The
    chat's own composer has never done that — a follow-up goes into the live
    host's inbox (`agent._send`) and is absorbed into the session — and this is
    that same path, taken by the scheduler.

    `_live_host` is the question "is there a session I can hand a follow-up to",
    which is true for the whole life of a chat, turn or no turn; `_live_run`
    (turn open) is the wrong one here, because a host idling between turns is
    precisely the case this exists for.

    **A LIVE HOST ALWAYS WINS, AND THE GUEST ADAPTS TO IT** (bugbot HIGH,
    2026-09-12). The round before this one asked the host first whether it could
    serve the message unchanged — an attachment directory it was not granted, an
    effort or a model the entry named and it was not on — and took the spawn
    where it could not. But the spawn is a `claude --resume` on that same session
    **while the idle host is still alive**: two writers on one transcript, which
    is the exact failure this whole path exists to prevent. A mismatch is not a
    reason to start a second process next to a live one; it is a reason for the
    GUEST to give something up. So where there is a host, the message goes into
    it with **nothing of the entry's own settings attached**:

    * **No read-dir grant.** `--allowed-tools` is fixed at spawn, so a directory
      the host was not started with cannot be added by sending; asking for one
      makes `agent._send` TREE-KILL the chat's session to force a respawn. Sent
      with `read_dirs=""`, an image the host cannot read raises an ordinary
      permission card in a chat that is open, which the user is sitting in front
      of and can answer — strictly better than either ending their session or
      running a second `claude` beside it.
    * **The host's own model and effort**, and (as before) its own permission
      mode. `effort` is fixed at spawn; `set_model`/`set_permission_mode` are
      applied MID-SESSION and stay applied, so an entry naming either would
      quietly rewrite the settings of a chat somebody is using, for every turn
      after this one. An inbox message runs under the settings its session
      already has, exactly as a message typed into that composer would.

    With all four empty, `agent._send` can never reach its respawn arm: the host
    is never killed, and no second process is ever spawned beside it. Only when
    there is NO live host does `_send` spawn.

    An `{"error": …}` back — the host died between `_live_host` and the write —
    is None, and the caller spawns: the host is gone, so there is nothing to
    race, and the message is owed either way.

    **The entry is marked `host_sent`**, because what this returns is not a run
    of ours: the run id is the CHAT'S session host, shared with the page, and a
    cancel aimed at this entry must never tear it down (see `_send` and
    `_turn_tick`).

    Flag-gated and best-effort: with the project queue off this is not reached
    at all and the pass is the one that shipped, and any failure here is simply
    a spawn, which is what the scheduler did before this existed.

def _chain_session(template_id: str, ran: str) -> None:
    """Teach a chaining template which conversation its runs live in — once.

    THIS IS WHAT MAKES CHAINING THE DEFAULT rather than merely the documented
    intention. `_materialize` gives an occurrence the template's `session_id`,
    so a template that has one repeats into one thread; but a template created
    from the Tasks page has none, and nothing else ever gave it one — the
    watcher writes the session a run landed in onto the OCCURRENCE
    (`claude_session_id`), and an occurrence is thrown away. So the template
    stayed empty for ever and every run started fresh, making the "new task
    each run" opt-out indistinguishable from leaving it unticked. The first run
    of a chaining template answers the question the template could not, and
    this is where that answer is carried back to it.

    The distinction the module rests on is NOT weakened by that. `session_id`
    is still the input ("resume this one", "" meaning start fresh) and
    `claude_session_id` still the answer ("what it ran in"); no entry's own
    session_id is rewritten to match its own answer, which is the move that
    would retroactively relabel a fresh send as a continuation. Run 1 keeps
    saying it started fresh. What travels is run 1's answer into run 2's input,
    across two different entries, which is the ordinary direction of the link.

    Four conditions, each load-bearing:

    * **Only a live template.** An occurrence's `template_id` is the only way
      up; a one-off has none and never reaches here.
    * **Only when the template is CHAINING.** With `new_task_each_run` ticked
      the template must keep minting fresh sessions for ever, so it must never
      learn one.
    * **Only into an EMPTY `session_id`.** A template that already has one was
      told which conversation to continue (a task handed off from a chat), and
      that is the user's decision, not this function's. It is also what makes
      the writeback idempotent and the thread stable: the first run wins, later
      ticks of the same turn re-report the same id and find the field taken, so
      the store is not rewritten.
    * **The pending successor is fixed up too.** `_materialize` runs on every
      tick and only waits for an occurrence to leave `pending`/`sending` — so
      run 2 can already exist, minted with "", before run 1's session is
      reported. Filling in that one entry here is what stops the race from
      costing a whole occurrence its thread. Only `pending` ones: a finished
      occurrence's input is a historical fact.

    Same locked read-modify-write as every other mutation here, and for the
    same reason — this runs on a watcher thread, mutating a DIFFERENT entry
    than the one being watched, while other watchers may be reporting. No
    `_sync_wake`: not one due time moves, and the stub costs two subprocesses.

    has already filed a verdict for?

    THE 45-SECOND WINDOW LIES IN EXACTLY ONE DIRECTION, and the scheduler was
    the surface paying for it (browser QA, 2026-09-12). A leader finished its
    turn at T — `turn_at` stamped, `_turn_ended` rang the loop — and the message
    typed behind it did not go until T+60, three whole ticks later. Nothing was
    busy and the folder was free: `_session_live` was reading the finished
    turn's OWN closing rows as a live turn, because a non-interactive run writes
    no `turn_duration` record for `tail_activity` to find and the window has
    nothing else to go on. The hold was holding a message against the very turn
    it was waiting for.

    So the same reasoning the Tasks router already applies to the same lie
    (`tasks._verdict_outvotes_live`): when the newest verdict we WATCHED land
    for this conversation is stamped, and the tail after it is that turn's own
    closing rows, the tail is an obituary and not a pulse.

    **THE TAIL'S SHAPE DECIDES, AND THE CLOCK IS ONLY A CEILING** (round-3
    review, 2026-09-12). Measuring by the stamp alone silenced a HUMAN turn
    that genuinely began inside the window — the user typing three seconds
    after the leader finished is activity "younger than verdict + 15s" and was
    read as the leader's echo, which is two processes on one transcript
    arriving through the very rule that was meant to stop them. A transcript
    says which it is: `session_liveness.session_turn_open` walks back to the
    last MESSAGE, and a `user` row (or an assistant row mid-tool-call) is a
    turn somebody has open right now — never an echo, whatever the clock says.
    Only once the file's last word is a finished assistant reply does
    `VERDICT_ECHO_SEC` get asked, and there it does the job it was widened for:
    activity still appending 15 seconds past the verdict is sustained work
    keeping its vote, not a handful of closing rows.

    **Re-read only where it can change the answer.** The verdict is looked up
    first (in memory, off entries this pass already holds), so the transcript is
    re-read only for a session that both reads live AND has a watched, stamped
    verdict; the shape read settles most of those on its own and the freshness
    read happens only behind it. `seen` memoizes the whole answer within one
    pass, like `_session_live`'s own.

    **Not flag-gated** (Akshil, 2026-09-16; it was, on a blast-radius
    argument). It is a correctness fix for the pre-existing per-session hold:
    with the queue off a follow-up still waited out the whole 45-second window
    on the finished turn's own closing rows, and only the 30-second poll ended
    it. The project-queue flag guards the one-task-per-folder RULE, not the
    sync improvements that came with it.

    The one walk, shared by the two callers that both mean "collapse a run of
    past slots into the last of them, and never replay the rest":

    * `_coalesce`, for a repeat the app slept through — those slots were on the
      calendar, so `spend=True` bills each to `made` and the caller counts them
      onto the survivor as `skipped`;
    * `_catch_up_base`, for a rule created with an anchor already in the past —

      and there is nothing to report as skipped. (That is also the rule
      `_upcoming_rule` already projects by; Bugbot, PR #541.)

    Three ways to stop, all of them load-bearing:

    * **`ValueError`** — a hand-edited schedule that no longer parses. Left for
      `_materialize`, which is where that verdict is announced; the caller keeps
      the time it has already reached.
    * **`None` or past `now`** — the ordinary end: the series is spent, or the
      next slot is in the future and is therefore not a catch-up at all.
    * **a step that does not MOVE.** Recurrence math is done on local
      wall-clock time (a repeat is a wall-clock promise), so the autumn
      fall-back — where one local hour happens twice — can hand back a later
      local time that converts to an earlier or equal UTC instant. Stepping on
      it would walk the same hour for as long as the cap allows. The repo

    discarded every late recurring run; this keeps the last one and drops the
    rest, because "daily at 9am" replayed seven times into one thread on Monday
    morning is not what the words meant, while running it once — late — is.

    **Two shapes of backlog reach here, and both have to work.** Which one the
    store holds depends only on how the app was closed:

    * **One stale pending occurrence** is the ordinary case. `_materialize`
      keeps exactly one run ahead of a template and refuses to make another
      while it is still pending, so an app closed for a week reopens with a
      single occurrence dated a week ago — and the six runs in between exist
      only in the recurrence, never in the store. Those are found by WALKING
      (`_next_template_due`), not by counting ticks: the walk asks the rule
      which occurrences lie between that due time and now.
    * **Several past-due pending occurrences** happen when something else put
      them there — `restore` un-skipping a run beside its successor, or a
      hand-edited store. All but the newest are marked `missed`; the newest is
      the survivor, and the walk continues from it.

    The dropped runs are COUNTED, never replayed: `skipped` accumulates on the
    survivor and `skipped_note` is the sentence the UI shows ("5 earlier runs
    skipped"). One `missed` event is emitted for the whole collapse rather than
    one per dropped run — a toast per skipped run is precisely the storm this
    exists to prevent.

    `made` moves with the walk for a rule template, because it must: it counts
    what the template put on the calendar, and the docstring on `create` is
    explicit that skipped runs count. That also ends a `count` series honestly —
    `_next_template_due` answers None once the budget is spent, which stops the
    walk exactly where materialization would have stopped.

    Occurrences it touches lose any legacy `max_late`, so the survivor is sent
    rather than swept to `missed` by the bound coalescing replaced.

    Only PENDING entries are read and only PENDING entries are written, which is
    what keeps this from resurrecting anything: an entry the old bound already

    **The inconsistency this fixes.** A one-off scheduled for last Tuesday runs
    the moment the app opens — the queue sorts it to the head and sends it, and
    the docstring on `create` is explicit that this is what picking a past date
    means. A REPEAT anchored last Tuesday did nothing at all until the next slot
    came round, because materialization computed from `now` and a past anchor
    therefore only ever set the PHASE. Two ways of saying "starting last
    Tuesday", two different answers, and nothing on the form to tell you which
    one you were about to get.

    **Which past slot runs is the LATEST one, not the anchor.** The anchor sets
    the pattern; the run that goes is the most recent slot at or before now:

        anchor Aug 15 09:00 · daily · now = Aug 17 10:00
          Aug 15 09:00   no run        <- the anchor only sets the pattern

          Aug 18 09:00   upcoming

    That is the same rule `_coalesce` applies to a repeat the app slept through,
    and it is the same walk (`_walk_latest`) — "daily at 9am" started last
    Tuesday does not mean three mornings replayed, it means this morning's, run
    late. The intervening slots are never materialized: they did not happen and
    never will. And the `due` that survives is that slot's own real time, not
    `now`, so the chip stays in the column it belongs to (see the `at` /
    `ran_at` split on the Tasks side).

    `spend=False` on the walk, because those slots cost the `count` budget
    nothing — the rule did not exist when they went by, so nothing put them on a
    calendar. Only the occurrence `_materialize` actually creates is billed, and
    it bills it in the ordinary place. This is the same accounting
    `_upcoming_rule` already projects by (Bugbot, PR #541).

    Two conditions guard it, each preventing a double helping:

    * **a rule template only.** A cron template has no anchor; `create` computes
      its first occurrence from `now` by construction, so there is no past slot
      to catch up to and nothing to decide.
    * **no occurrences, ever.** `existing` empty AND `made` zero. A template
      that has been running has its backlog handled by `_coalesce` already;
      reaching back here as well would collapse the same run twice, and a
      template whose only occurrence was CANCELLED must not have that cancel
      undone by a fresh catch-up.

    The returned base is a hair BEFORE the chosen slot, because
    `recur.next_occurrence` is strictly-after and `_materialize` asks it for
    "the next one after base" — this is how the slot itself comes back. Every
    occurrence after it is computed from `now` in the ordinary way, so the
    series continues rather than replaying.

    (sent, missed, error, cancelled — any of them) gets the next one. The next

# is owned (`fused_render/queue_manager.py`, PR 2). What is left here is the one
# question dispatch has to answer that neither of them covers: which
# conversation a message typed behind another message belongs to.


def _follow_session(entry: dict, by_id: dict) -> tuple[str, bool]:
    """`(the conversation this entry should resume, may it go yet)` — the
    dispatch half of `follow_of`.

    A message typed into a chat whose FIRST message is still queued names that
    first message instead of a session, because there is no session yet. Three
    answers, and each is the leader's state read plainly:

    * **the leader has RUN** (`claude_session_id`) — go, resuming it. That id is
      written onto this entry as it is claimed (`_claim`), which is the one-off
      twin of `_chain_session` feeding a template's next run: the answer of one
      run becomes the input of the next, across two entries.
    * **the leader has not run yet** — pending, claimed for sending, or sent
      with its turn still open — HOLD. Left `pending` and untouched like every
      other hold here. The folder rule mostly does this already (the leader is
      usually the holder), but it is stated here because the two messages are
      ONE task: a folder freed by something else must not let the second message
      of a conversation open the conversation.
    * **the leader ended without a session** — cancelled, missed, or a send that
      broke before Claude Code minted one — run FRESH. The message is still
      owed, and there is no thread to continue; an orphan that waited for ever
      would be this feature losing the user's words.

    The IMMEDIATE leader, not the head of the chain: a follower of a follower is
    held by its own leader, which is in turn held by its own, so the order falls
    out one link at a time. An erased leader means the entry stands alone —
    exactly what it did before the field existed, and so does a chain too long

    owns a folder, so a pass that re-derived it would be a second answer to the
    same question. `enqueue` is idempotent (a message that came due three
    passes ago is already in its line and appending it again is a no-op) and it
    pumps, so a folder that is free starts the head of its line inside this
    call.

    **A message with NO folder is dispatched straight.** `queue_key` answers ""
    for a target this app will not gate — no path, `$HOME`, the filesystem root
    — and "" is "no folder" everywhere: never held, always free. Handing those
    to the manager would put every ungated message on the machine in ONE line
    behind one another, which is the exact thing `queue_key` refuses `$HOME`
    for. They go through the same door (`dispatch_entry`, session gates and
    all), just with nobody in front of them.

    **`SpawnBusy` is a wait.** Straight dispatch raises it for a conversation
    that is mid-turn; the entry is left `pending` and untouched, exactly as the
    old loop's `continue` left it, and the next tick sends it. Inside the
    manager the same exception leaves the item at the head of its line.

    """One pass: sweep, then claim-and-send each due message ONE AT A TIME.

    The claim happens inside this loop rather than in the sweep so that a
    process dying inside one helper leaves its siblings `pending` — still
    sendable on the next tick — instead of stranded mid-claim (see `_claim_due`).

    **One send at a time per session, whoever is holding it.** A spawn returns as
    soon as the detached process is away, not when the turn ends, so without this
    two messages that resume the SAME session — two "in 5 minutes" landing in one
    tick, or a follow-up coming due while an earlier one is still working — would
    run concurrent `claude --resume` processes over one transcript.

    Two things make a session busy and both are checked here, because the
    scheduler is not the only thing that can be talking to it:

    * **a scheduled send in flight** (`_busy_sessions`), read from this module's
      own store;
    * **a live turn**, read from the transcript (`_session_live`). That covers
      the user typing in the explorer's chat, which the store cannot see and
      which used to be a stated known gap here. The transcript records the turn
      without recording who started it, which is exactly the property needed —
      and the one thing it cannot tell apart on its own is a turn that just
      ENDED from one still going, which is what `_verdict_echo` settles with
      this module's own record of the verdict.

    **One send at a time per FOLDER is NOT decided here** (PR 2, 2026-09-17).
    With the project queue on this function is not the dispatcher: it hands
    what came due to the queue manager and returns (`_tick_queued`), and the
    manager's index is the only record of who owns a working tree. What is
    below runs with the flag off — and in a build with no manager — and it is
    byte-for-byte the pass that shipped before the feature existed.

    **Deferred, never dropped.** An entry targeting a busy session (or a busy
    folder) is left `pending` and untouched — no state is written for it at all
    — so a later tick sends it once the turn ends. Catch-up is unbounded by default, so waiting
    costs it nothing; only an install that set `FUSED_RENDER_SCHEDULE_MAX_LATE`
    can eventually see one swept to `missed`, which is that operator's bound
    doing what they asked and is the same answer the hold has always given.

    **A hold that ends on a clock asks to be woken.** Most holds end on an event
    that already rings the loop (`_turn_ended`, the watcher seeing a run's
    process go). One does not — a transcript that reads live until its window
    lapses — so a pass that held for it arms one timer for the moment that clock
    actually runs out (`_rearm`) rather than leaving the work to the 30-second
    poll.

    Returns the entries actually claimed and attempted, which is the seam the
    tests drive directly instead of waiting on the loop."""

    `took` is what every early return below reads before handing the tree back
    (`_release_folder`). A run-now on a message that follows a chat which

    What the Board's Upcoming -> In Progress drag means. Everything about it is
    the ordinary send brought forward; nothing about it is a second way to send.

    **`due` is not touched, and that is the point.** The obvious implementation
    rewrites the due time to now so the row "looks" consistent, and it destroys
    the only record of what was asked for: the schedule time is a fact about the
    ask, and a message that ran early is a message that ran early. The row reads
    `due` in the future and `fired` now, which is exactly what happened — and it
    is the same split `_entry_at` / `_entry_ran_at` draws on the Tasks side, so
    the calendar still draws the chip on the day the user picked.

    **What a DEFERRED run-now leaves behind is `run_now_at`, not a moved `due`.**
    The rule above held right up until this could answer "queued" instead of
    "sent": a message due tomorrow, skipped to the head of a busy folder's line,
    was in a line nothing could see it in — every reader asks "due ≤ now" and
    tomorrow is not, so the row read `upcoming` again the moment the optimistic
    paint cleared and the scheduler would have waited until tomorrow (browser
    QA, 2026-09-12). A second stamp is the answer: `due` stays the ask, and
    everything that asks "is this waiting to go right now" reads the earlier of
    the two (`_queue_due`, `tasks._queue_at`). Both deferring arms write it —
    see `_asked_now`.

    **The claim is reused, not reimplemented.** `_claim` is the single
    `pending -> sending` transition in this module and it re-reads under the
    lock, so run-now and the tick race each other exactly the way two ticks
    would: one wins, the other is told the entry is no longer pending. Nothing
    can be sent twice, and there is no second spawn path to keep in step with
    claim-before-spawn.

    **A recurring occurrence runs alone.** An occurrence is an ordinary one-shot
    with a `template_id`; running it early leaves the template's `due`, its
    `made`, and its rule untouched, and `_materialize` computes the successor
    from that occurrence's own (unmoved) due time exactly as it would have if
    the occurrence had fired at its proper minute. One run happened sooner; the
    series did not move.

    **A busy session is refused, not forced.** If a turn is already open in the
    conversation this message resumes — one of ours, or the user's own typing —
    sending would put two processes on one transcript, which is the hazard
    `_session_live` exists for and is not one a drag gesture can consent to. The
    entry stays pending, stamped `run_now_at` so "the ordinary tick sends it
    when the conversation goes quiet" is true whatever its `due` says, and the
    reason says so. A turn this module has already filed a verdict for is not
    open, however fresh the transcript looks — `_verdict_echo`.

    **A busy FOLDER is a skip, not a refusal** (project queue on). Another task
    is editing this working tree, so this one cannot go now — but the gesture
    still means something exact, and it is not "nothing happened": Run now on a
    queued task is the Skip verb. The entry is marked `priority`, which puts it
    at the head of its folder's line, and stamped `run_now_at`, which is what
    puts it in that line at all when its `due` is still ahead; it comes back
    `ok: false` with
    `reason: "queued"`, `queued: true` and the position it now holds, so the
    row can read `#1 in line · behind TASK-041` instead of an error. It really
    does run next, within a second or two of that folder freeing (`wake`).

    `found` distinguishes "no such id" (a 404) from "cannot run this one"
    (a 409); the router is what turns them into status codes."""

# ------------------------------------------------------------------ re-sending
#
# A message that RAN and broke has no pending entry — `run_now` claims a pending
# one, and the run that failed spent itself. So the Re-run affordance the user
# asked for could not be offered in the exact case they asked for it, and no
# amount of button wiring fixes that: the store had no verb for it.
#
# **The verb is not "run that row again", it is "ask again".** A task is a
# thread and asking for the work a second time is another MESSAGE in that
# thread, not a rewriting of the message that failed. Everything below falls out
# of that one sentence:
#
#   * the original entry is untouched — its `state`, `due`, `fired` and `error`
#     stay, so history keeps saying that run happened and broke. Same principle
#     as run-now not touching `due`: what was asked for, and what happened, are
#     facts and not fields to tidy;
#   * the new entry is an ordinary one-off `pending` at `due = now`, created by
#     `create` like any other message and sent by `run_now` like any other
#     early send. No second construction path and no second spawn path;
#   * it resumes the session the original actually RAN in
#     (`claude_session_id`), so the re-ask continues the conversation rather
#     than opening a second one beside it.

# The states a message may be re-sent FROM: a run that went and ended.
#
# `sent` covers every way a turn resolved — ok, failed, cancelled, unknown —
# because all of them are "it went", and a turn that ended badly is the ordinary
# reason to ask again. `error` is a send that never got off the ground, which is
# the same news one step earlier.
#
# A `sent` entry whose turn is still OPEN is deliberately included rather than
# refused: the new message simply queues behind it. `_busy_sessions` holds it
# until the turn ends, which is the serialisation two messages into one thread
# have always had, and is a better answer than a refusal the user would have to
# re-issue by hand a minute later.

    is not a reason to do nothing, it is a reason to use the other button.

    **`missed` and `cancelled` are refused, and for the same reason:** neither

    of the two — its commonest source is `_coalesce` dropping a repeat's stale
    runs, and a re-send button that replayed them one at a time would undo,
    click by click, the one rule that stops a week of "daily at 9am" landing in
    a thread on Monday morning. `cancelled` is a decision the user made; undoing
    it is `restore`'s job on the one cancel worth walking back (a skipped
    occurrence), not this one's. Both are told to schedule it again, which is
    the honest way to ask for work that never ran."""

def resend(entry_id: str, now: datetime | None = None) -> dict:
    """Ask again: store the original's message as a NEW one-off due now and send
    it. `{"ok", "entry", "reason", "found"}`, where `entry` is the NEW entry.

    **The original is not modified in any way.** It is read, and that is all.
    A row that says "this ran at 09:00 and broke" goes on saying it.

    **The new entry continues the same thread.** `session_id` is copied from the
    original's `claude_session_id` — the session its turn actually ran in, which
    is the only field that knows — so the re-ask resumes that conversation. It
    is stamped `session_learned`, because that id was learned by the system from
    a run rather than chosen by a user, which is exactly the provenance
    `_chain_session` records when it teaches a template the same fact. An
    original that never reached a session (a send that failed before Claude
    Code minted one) copies "", and the new message opens a fresh thread — the
    only honest answer when there is no thread to continue.

    **`template_id` is NOT carried, and that is the load-bearing decision.** A
    re-send is a manual re-ask, not a scheduled run of the rule, and counting it
    as an occurrence would corrupt the series three ways at once: `_materialize`
    refuses to make a template's next run while any occurrence of it is pending,
    so a re-send would BLOCK the schedule for as long as it sat in the queue;
    `_coalesce` would read it as backlog and could move its due time or mark it
    missed; and cancelling the template would cascade onto it. The `count` /
    `until` budgets are the fourth: `made` measures what the template put on the
    calendar, and a button press never did. So the new entry is a plain one-off
    — the template's `made`, its `due` and its future occurrences are as
    untouched as the original entry is.

    **The claim path is reused, not reimplemented.** The new entry is created by
    `create` and sent by `run_now`, which claims through `_claim` like
    everything else. Claim-before-spawn is unchanged, and there is no second way
    to spawn to keep in step.

    `ok` is true once the new message EXISTS, not only when it went out
    immediately. If the conversation it resumes has a turn running, `run_now`
    refuses the early send and says so; the entry stays pending at the head of
    the queue and the ordinary tick sends it when the turn ends. Reporting that
    as a failure would be a lie about a message that is really scheduled — so it
    comes back in `reason` as a note beside `ok: true`.

    `found` distinguishes "no such id" (a 404) from "cannot re-send this one"
    (a 409), exactly as `run_now` does; the router maps them.

    Raises ValueError for a target that has since been deleted (`create`'s own
    validation), which the router turns into a 400."""
