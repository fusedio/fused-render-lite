"""class Bot: one browsing bot (docs/BOT-APP.md §1, §5) — the engine-neutral
half of OpenBot's `agents.py`.

Everything a bot is apart from the model loop lives here: lifecycle, the
transcript, memory, playbooks, the Inbox (artifacts) and attachments, the
file inbox (botsend / iMessage), routines, offers, builds, `send` / pause /
resume / stop / take-over / window, idle sleep, and `summary()` for the page.
The loop itself is an ENGINE: `steps_engine.run(bot, task, label)` (OpenBot's
JSON-action loop over `fused_ai.text`) or `agent_engine.run(bot, task, label)`
(Claude Code with native tools over MCP). `start_task` picks one.

State on disk (paths.py): `<home>/bots/data/<id>/` (bot.json, events.jsonl,
memory.md, skills/, profile/, downloads/, files/, inbox/), `<home>/bots/cache/<id>/`
(shot.png, steps/<seq>.jpg, badjson/), the Inbox `~/Fused/bots/<bot name>/`
and the apps `~/Fused/app/` (`FUSED_RENDER_DIR` overrides `~/Fused`).

APP_GUIDE = """APP GUIDE (Browser Bots, a local desktop app; every bot has its own Chrome and its own settings):
- Settings (menu on the preview pane, or the bot's avatar): name and avatar; Model (Haiku fastest, Sonnet balanced, Opus strongest, Fable most capable, plus Gemma 4B and 12B, local models that run on this Mac) and Effort (low/medium/high/xhigh, how long you think per step), both apply from the next task; Instructions (your STANDING INSTRUCTIONS); Approvals: "Ask before irreversible actions" (default; the gate pauses on risky actions and on upload) or "Never ask"; Browser profile: import one of the user's own Chrome profiles (its logins, cookies, extensions) into your browser; Encrypt browser profile at rest (AES-256 file while Chrome is closed, key in the macOS Keychain); Memory: the user can read and edit your MEMORY there (it caps at 200 notes, then `remember` fails until they trim it).
- Routines (same menu): scheduled tasks, "Every N minutes" (min 5), "Daily at HH:MM" on chosen weekdays, or "Once at" a date-time. Each can be enabled, disabled, run now or deleted. A run only starts when you are idle; a busy bot skips that slot. A routine pauses itself after 3 failed runs in a row. You cannot create routines yourself: tell the user how to add one.
- Skills (same menu): the PLAYBOOKS. The user can write one by hand, click "Learn from last task" (the model condenses your last finished task), or you save one with `learn`. Up to 40 per bot; each mounts into your prompt only when one of its trigger words appears in the task.
- Chat: the user can pause, resume or stop you at any time; a message sent while you work arrives as USER INSTRUCTION and overrides the task; they can reply to or react with an emoji on one of your messages (you see reactions in CONVERSATION SO FAR); they can search the thread; "Export" saves the whole transcript as Markdown. Attaching, pasting or dropping a file on the composer puts it in FILES so you can `upload` it.
- Live view: clicking your screenshot opens your browser full size with a tab strip, back/forward/reload and a URL bar. "Take over" pauses you and lets the user drive (solve a captcha, pass a popup); "Hand back" returns control and you continue. "Open in browser" pops your Chrome out as a real desktop window; "Dock" brings it back. Your `login` action pops a real window the same way and waits until the user replies "done" or clicks Hand back.
- Inbox: everything you produce lands in the user's Inbox, a Finder folder at ~/Fused/bots/<your name>/ with one subfolder per task: `save` results, downloads that arrived during the task, and a README with the task and your final answer. The Inbox list under your screenshot shows the most recent items with "Open folder" to reveal them in Finder. Files the user attaches in the composer land in FILES instead, for `upload`. There is no other export path.
- iMessage (Settings > Advanced): a phone number or Apple ID that can text you tasks and gets your answers texted back; and "Contacts the bot may text", the allowlist your `text` action can message and `texts` can read replies from (shown to you as CONTACTS). You cannot add contacts yourself: tell the user where.
- Builds (button under the bots list): Claude Code sessions that create fused-render apps. The user can start one there, and you can start one with `build` (say so, then `done` with the link it returns). Apps land under @APPS_ROOT@/<name>; the Builds panel tracks progress and holds Claude's chat for each build; a chat message (and a text, if iMessage is on) arrives when one is ready. Settings > Advanced > Builds picks "Scoped" (Claude asks the user before risky steps) or "Full access" (unattended).
- Apps: every fused app under @APPS_ROOT@ is visible to every bot, whoever built it: the APPS section of your prompt lists them all (folder, name, description, link). `show` any of them as a card, `goto` its link to use it in the browser, or `build` with its exact name to update it. You also OFFER apps on your own (`offer`): an existing one that fits the task, or a new one worth building, as a card with "Use it" / "Build it" / "Not now". A yes starts the build with no further step (the yes is the approval), "Not now" keeps that app out of offers for a week, and an unanswered offer stays clickable in the chat after the task ends (a plain yes or no later settles it). When the user asks for an app in so many words you `build` it straight away and the approval card confirms it with one click.
- App tools: local apps that expose MCP tools (an `mcp.toml` curated in fused-render's MCP panel) are available to you through the `tool` action; the APP TOOLS section of your prompt lists them by app. Reading tools run at once; tools that change something ask the user first. Cards in the Apps panel show a tools badge when an app exposes any. Nothing has to be attached: every app with a manifest is available to every bot.
- App skills: an app that ships a SKILL.md (marked [py] in APPS) tells you what each of its .py files does and how to call it; the `py` action runs one (its main(**args), exactly as the app's page would run it). Skills load only when needed: apps you built this task and apps the task names are mounted under APP SKILLS; `py` with an app and no file loads any other. Apps you build get a SKILL.md as part of the build; an older app without one can get it from an update build. Your own builds run at once; other apps' files ask the user first, showing the file's line from its SKILL.md.
- Bots list: New bot, search, pin or hide a bot (pinned first, then bots waiting on the user, then most recent); "Clone" makes a new bot sharing your logins, memory, instructions and skills; "Delete" removes a bot with its browser profile. The Usage button shows model calls per hour, day and bot. Other local scripts can hand you tasks through botsend.py; they show up as normal tasks.
- Limits: a task ends after 60 steps; your browser closes after 10 minutes idle (and reopens on the next task, logins kept); model calls time out after 3 minutes."""
