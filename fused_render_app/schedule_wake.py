"""The OS-side half of scheduled messages: make sure the app is RUNNING when a
message comes due.

`schedule.py` owns the schedule, the send, and every decision in between — for
the reasons in its docstring, all of which come down to a scheduled turn needing
the app's environment, credentials and (on macOS) TCC identity. The cost of that
choice is that nothing fires while the app is closed. This module buys back as
much of that as an OS can be asked for honestly: it does not send anything, it
does not know what a message is, it just asks the platform to *launch the app*
at the times something is due. The app then does what it always does on
startup — its first tick catches up whatever came due.

**macOS: a LaunchAgent.** `launchd` is the right mechanism and `cron` is not.
A per-user LaunchAgent runs inside the user's GUI (Aqua) session, so the app it
launches has the login Keychain and can prompt for consent like any other app
the user opened; `launchd` also runs a missed `StartCalendarInterval` when the
machine next wakes, which `cron` simply does not do. The agent's program is
`open -g -a <bundle>` — the same thing double-clicking the app does, only
without stealing focus — so nothing here needs to know how the app starts.

**Windows and Linux: nothing new, deliberately.** Both already have a
start-at-login toggle that the supervisor owns (`_win32/startup.py`'s Run key,
`_linux/startup.py`'s freedesktop autostart entry), and both platforms' packaged
app is a supervisor-managed process. Writing a second, schedule-specific timer
(a Task Scheduler task, a systemd user timer) would be a third mechanism that
can disagree with those two about whether the app should be running. What the
user gets on those platforms is therefore weaker and worth saying out loud: a
message fires if the app is running or gets started (including at login), and
waits if it is not.

Everything here is BEST-EFFORT and the caller treats it that way. A failure to
write a plist means messages fire a bit less reliably; it never means a message
is lost, and it must never fail the store write that triggered it.
