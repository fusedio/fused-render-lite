"""Drafts — what the composer and the New task modal were still typing.

Two surfaces lose text today. The chat composer keeps it in `useState`, seeded
once from a sessionStorage hop that is spent on read, so it dies on tab close,
on opening another chat, on reload. The New task modal keeps it per open and
`key="new#<seq>"` remounts blank, so closing the modal is the same as never
having typed. Neither is a place unfinished work can live, and unfinished work
is most of what a person has open at any moment.

**Server, one file, global.** `<FUSED_RENDER_HOME>/claude-sessions/drafts.json`
— the same never-branch-nested directory `tasks_store` keeps `task_ids.json`
and `read.json` in, and for exactly the same reason: chat drafts key on session
ids, and `~/.claude/projects` is one machine-wide pool. A draft written from a
worktree's dev server must be there when the packaged app opens the same
conversation.

Why not the alternatives (design.md, "Where drafts live"): a draft is not a
place you can link to, so not the URL; the `✎ Draft` badge in the List and the
Board needs the server to join draft ↔ task row and `/api/tasks` is
server-rendered, so not localStorage; and `state:"draft"` inside `tasks.jsonl`
would put a row with no `due` in front of schedule.py's ticker, claim and queue,
every one of which assumes there is one. A separate store, joined at read.

Shape::

    {"chat": {"<session-id>": {"text": …, "attachments": […], "updated_at": …,
                               "version": …, "form": {…}?}},
     "task": {"<draft-id>": {"title": …, …, "created_at": …, "updated_at": …,
                             "version": …}}}

**One record, one version.** Every record carries a `version` an int at a time,
stamped by `_update` on each write (`_stamp`), and every write may be
conditional on it (`if_version`, the routes' `If-Match`): a second window that
saved since the caller last read loses with a `VersionConflict` carrying the
record it lost to, instead of overwriting it. `form` is the other half of that
round — the Schedule hop's New task modal edits the CHAT record it was opened
on rather than minting a `draft:<id>` of its own, so a chat draft carries the
settings the modal set (`CHAT_FORM_FIELDS`) beside the words
(design-drafts-one-record.md).

**One record, two doors.** A task draft that names a session (`session_id`) IS
that conversation's unsent message, so the composer is a second door onto it:
a session with a bound form and no chat record of its own reads and writes that
form's words from the chat half (`bound_chats`, `chat_view`, `put_chat`). Never
a copy — the words are in exactly one record, and which door the reader comes
back through does not change what they find. The bug that asked for it: hop out
of a finished session, type, press Schedule, click outside the modal, and the
row wore the `✎ Draft` chip while the composer the chip's press led to was
empty (Akshil, 2026-09-12).

**Empty is never stored.** Writing an empty draft IS deleting it — there is no
such thing as a draft with nothing in it, and a store that kept one would paint
a `✎ Draft` badge on a task whose composer is blank. `put_chat` and `put_task`
therefore both answer `None` for a write they turned into a delete, so the
caller never has to ask which of the two it just did.

**Nothing here raises for input it cannot read.** A missing store, a corrupt
store, a record of the wrong shape, an attachment row with no path — each
degrades to "no draft", never to a failed request. Same posture as tasks_store
and every other registry in this package: a draft is a convenience, and a
convenience that can break a page is worse than one that is missing.

No import of anything under `fused_render.server`, and none of
`fused_render.schedule` either — importing the schedule model to borrow its
`_attachments` validator would pull the whole ticker, its storage seams and its
event log in behind it, for one shape check. The local validator below is
deliberately the LENIENT twin of that one: `schedule._attachments` refuses an
attachment whose file has gone, because a scheduled run must not be handed a
path it cannot read, where a draft is text somebody has not sent yet and losing
it over a moved file would be the store failing at its only job (Akshil,
2026-09-11).

DRAFTS_FILE = "drafts.json"

#: The two kinds, and the two top-level keys of the file. A chat draft belongs
#: to a conversation; a task draft belongs to nothing yet, which is why it needs
#: an id of its own.
CHAT = "chat"
TASK = "task"

#: …and a third section that is not a kind of draft: the LAST WRITE EACH PAGE
#: MADE to each key, `{key: {client: {"seq": …, "at": …}}}` — ONE ROW PER
#: (key, client), not per key.
#:
#: A version orders two DIFFERENT writers against each other; it cannot order
#: one writer against itself, because both of its requests state the version
#: they read and the network decides which arrives first. One page's own saves
#: for one key are a SEQUENCE — the syncer client-side mints a monotonic `seq`
#: per key and sends the whole desired state each time (`platform/lib/drafts.ts`,
#: `draftSyncer`) — so a request whose `seq` is not newer than the one already
#: applied from that same page is a STRAGGLER, and the only correct thing to do
#: with it is nothing.
#:
#: PER (key, client) RATHER THAN PER KEY, because a key is not one writer's:
#: two tabs on the same session are two different `client` ids racing the same
#: key, and a single slot means the second tab's write erases the first tab's
#: own history of itself — the exact case `_seq_fresh` exists to judge. With one
#: slot, a genuine straggler from tab A that lands after tab B has written (or
#: deleted) the same key is compared against B's note, sees a different
#: `client` and is waved through as "first write" — and if it carries
#: `If-Match: 0` against a key B just deleted, that waved-through write matches
#: "no record" and resurrects. Keeping A's own note alive under its own client
#: id, untouched by B's writes, is what lets `_seq_fresh` still catch it. Capped
#: at `_SEQ_MAX_CLIENTS_PER_KEY` so one key opened by a thousand tabs over a
#: laptop's lifetime cannot grow this section without bound; TTL unchanged.
SEQ = "seq"

#: How long one of those notes is worth keeping. A straggler is a request that
#: is already on the wire; a minute is an eternity for one, and a quarter of an
#: hour means a suspended laptop's queued write is still judged against the page
#: that queued it. After that the note is noise and `_prune` drops it, so the
#: section cannot grow without bound on a machine that opens a thousand folders.
_SEQ_TTL_SEC = 15 * 60

#: How many DIFFERENT clients' notes one key keeps at once, on top of the TTL
#: above. The TTL alone bounds how long a note lives; this bounds how many can
#: pile up on one key inside that window — a shared key a lot of tabs are
#: hammering at once (the same reasoning, bounded by count instead of by the
#: clock). The oldest-seen client is evicted first, same as the TTL sweep would
#: eventually do to it anyway.
_SEQ_MAX_CLIENTS_PER_KEY = 8

#: A chat with no session yet (the composer's first message has not been sent)
#: keys on the file it opened on instead — the same key `takeDraft(file)` uses
#: in the client.
#:
#: Round 1 said such a key never joined a listing and was never re-keyed: the
#: first send deleted the draft, and that was the end of it. Round 2 reversed
#: both halves. A `new:<file>` draft IS a row (the folder is its project, the
#: first line its title, and it carries a TASK number like any other), and the
#: first send therefore has somewhere to carry that number TO: `new:<file>` →
#: the session id, by the same `tasks_store.rekey` that moves
#: `pending:<entry-id>` forward. WHO makes that move is the SERVER, off the run
#: the send TAGGED with this key (`draft_key` in its `meta.json`,
#: `routers/tasks.py::_settle_new_chats`): a page cannot tell which session id
#: its own send created, and four rounds of trying is how we know (Bugbot, PR
#: #1118, 2026-09-12) — but it can name the draft it just spent. Nothing about
#: the SHAPE changed; what
#: changed is that the key is now worth keeping (design.md, "Round 2"; Akshil,
#: 2026-09-11).
NEW_CHAT_PREFIX = "new:"

#: A client-minted uuid, in practice. Validated as a shape rather than parsed as
#: a uuid so a client that mints `d-<random>` is not refused over a format
#: nothing in here depends on — what matters is that it is one path-free token
#: that cannot be confused with a task key.
_DRAFT_ID = re.compile(r"^[A-Za-z0-9_-]{8,64}$")

#: A session id as Claude Code writes it — the same shape
#: `tasks.py::_SESSION_ID_SHAPE` accepts, for the same reason: it becomes a
#: json key and is compared against task keys, and neither wants a separator.
_SESSION_KEY = re.compile(r"^[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9._-]{0,127}$")

#: How long a `new:<file>` key may be. A path, so generous; bounded at all so a
#: request body cannot grow the store's key space without limit.
_CHAT_KEY_MAX = 512

#: How much of a chat draft the `✎ Draft` badge's tooltip carries. The listing
#: joins a preview onto every session row, so this rides on rows the Tasks page
#: polls — one line is the whole affordance, and the rest of the draft is in the
#: composer where the user left it.
PREVIEW_MAX = 120

#: How long an unsent chat with no session yet may sit in the store before
#: `_prune` forgets it. A fortnight, which is long enough to cover a holiday and
#: short enough that the Upcoming lane is not a museum. Only `new:<file>` keys
#: age — see `_prune` for why the other two kinds never do.
CHAT_TTL_SEC = 14 * 24 * 60 * 60

#: Every field a task draft stores, in the order the form reads them. A key the
#: client sends that is not in here is DROPPED rather than refused (the modal
#: gains fields over time and an older server must not start 400ing a newer
#: page), and a field the client omits keeps whatever the stored draft had.

#: The SETTINGS half of a draft, spelled once and read from either record.
#:
#: A hop out of the composer no longer mints a second record: the New task modal
#: edits the chat draft it was opened on, so a `new:<file>` chat record carries
#: the form's fields beside its text, and a session-bound task record answers
#: the same shape out of the fields it already stores (`_form_of_task`). One
#: vocabulary, so a reader of `/api/drafts` never has to ask which of the two
#: records it is looking at (design-drafts-one-record.md, "Server model
#: deltas").
#:
#: The WORDS are not in here. They live in `text` on a chat record and in
#: `title`/`description` on a task record, joined and split by the one rule both
#: doors use (`split_draft`). `title` is the exception and is a form field too,
#: because the modal has a title box of its own that a person may edit away from
#: the first line of what they typed.

#: pass-through json (`when`, `repeat`, `custom_rule`) or a tri-state flag
#: (`new_task_each_run`) — the same split `_TASK_TEXT` draws, for the same
#: fields.
_FORM_TEXT = ("title", "model", "effort", "permission", "target")

#: validated as one.
#:
#: THIS IS A LIST OF SHAPES, NOT A DEFINITION OF CONTENT — see `_TASK_CONTENT`
#: below, which is the one that decides whether there is a draft here at all.
#: `session_id` is in neither: it is a destination, not something a person
#: typed. A form that arrives blank is still a delete even when it names the
#: session it was going to — which is exactly the bargain `an empty task put
#: keeps the chat draft` rests on (Akshil, 2026-09-11).
_TASK_TEXT = ("title", "description", "target", "model", "effort", "permission")

#: asks about separately because it is rows rather than text.
#:
#: Everything else the form holds — the folder, the model, the effort, the

#: with a draft, not a reason for one to exist. They used to count, and the
#: consequence was a card that minted an "Untitled draft" row on the List the
#: moment somebody changed the folder or opened the when-row and picked a time,
#: for a form holding nothing anybody had typed. It also left the reported
#: dead-end: clear the text and the row reads "Untitled draft"; remove the last

    THE JOIN ITSELF LIVES HERE and nowhere else, so `/api/drafts`, the composer
    and `routers/tasks.py`'s row chip cannot disagree about which draft a
    session's words are in.

    A STORED CHAT RECORD WINS outright: a session can have both — text left in

    title and description by the same rule the hop split it with
    (`split_draft`), so typing into the composer and typing into the card's two
    fields are edits to one record rather than to two copies of it.

    THE TRAY IS A REPLACEMENT AND NOT A UNION, unlike the fold `put_task` does
    between two FORMS (`_fold_into_bound`). That one reconciles a card that
    could not read the binding before it wrote, and so cannot tell "no files"
    from "did not ask"; this door always shows the whole tray, so a file
    missing from the write is a file the reader took out.

    EMPTY CLEARS THE WORDS AND KEEPS THE FORM (Akshil, 2026-09-15; design.md,
    PR C). It used to delete the whole record, on the chat half's reasoning that
    there is no half of a draft to keep — true of a chat draft, which IS its
    text, and false of a form. This door is the COMPOSER, and the composer's
    autosave fires after every send; the other door is a card holding a folder, a
    time, a repeat rule, a model, an effort, a permission mode and a tray that
    somebody spent a minute choosing. Sending a message into the conversation
    threw all of that away, and the person who had been setting it up had no way
    to know that pressing Enter was the gesture that did it.

    So an emptying write clears exactly what this door can see — title,
    description, attachments — and leaves every setting where it was. The record
    is then wordless, which every reader already treats as no draft: `chat_view`
    skips it, `_bound_chips` draws no chip, and `_empty_task` says a form with no
    words and no files is nothing anybody is writing. Deleting the RECORD is
    still possible and is still what the reader's own gesture does — Discard in
    the modal, the trash on the row, `DELETE /api/drafts/chat/<key>` on the
    composer's send — all of which go through an explicit delete rather than
    through here.

    `None` is answered either way, because the question this door was asked is
    "what does the composer hold now" and the answer is still nothing.

    THE SETTINGS COME THROUGH THIS DOOR TOO, as of the one-record round. The
    Schedule hop no longer mints a second draft: the New task modal it opens
    edits THIS record, writing the time, the repeat rule and the model as
    `form` alongside the words (`CHAT_FORM_FIELDS`), and on a bound session
    those fields already ARE the task record's own. A patch, field by field, so
    the composer's ordinary autosave — which says nothing about any of them —
    cannot clear what the modal set.

    "Empty" is no text and no attachments, which is the state a composer is in
    the moment its message is sent. The send path therefore does not have to
    choose between PUT and DELETE: writing what the box now holds is correct in
    both directions. Answers the stored record, or None when the write was a
    delete.

    …AND WHEN THIS SESSION'S WORDS ARE IN A BOUND FORM, the write goes THERE
    and no chat record is made (`bound_chats`, "one record, two doors"). Two
    records would be two rows, two chips and two versions of one sentence, and
    which of them the reader saw would depend on which door they came back
    through. The answer is that form read as a chat draft — the same shape a
    stored one has, `bound_draft` filled in — so the caller need not know which
    of the two it just wrote.

    The binding is looked up INSIDE the lock, with the write: a form bound (or
    emptied) between a read and a write outside one is exactly how the same
    sentence ends up in both halves of the store.

    `form` IS A PATCH AND IS OPTIONAL. The New task modal opened by the
    Schedule hop writes back through this door — same key, same record, no
    `draft:<id>` minted — so the settings it edits ride here beside the words
    (`CHAT_FORM_FIELDS`). Omitted, the stored settings stand: the composer's own
    autosave knows nothing about them and must not be able to clear them. Sent,
    only the fields it names move, so `{"when": null}` clears a time and a form
    that never mentions the model keeps it.

    EMPTYING A DRAFT THAT CARRIES SETTINGS CLEARS THE WORDS AND KEEPS THEM —
    the same bargain `_put_bound` makes on a bound session, now that the two are
    one record seen through two doors. The record then reads as no draft to
    every reader (`chat_view` skips it, no row, no chip), so nothing about that
    is visible; what survives is the time somebody chose.

    `if_version` is the caller's `If-Match`: the version it believes this key is
    at, compared inside the lock against the record this write would touch —
    the bound form's when there is one, since that is the record being written.
    A mismatch raises `VersionConflict` carrying the current state and writes
    nothing; `None` is an unconditional write, which is what every client that
    predates versions sends.

    `client`/`seq` are the page's own sequence for this key (`SEQ`): a write
    that is not newer than the last one THAT page made here raises `StaleWrite`
    and changes nothing. Checked BEFORE the version, because a straggler is not

    NON-EMPTY IS THE WHOLE TEST, field by field. A blank title is not "clear the

    modal's autosave may send only what it knows; fields the client sent that
    this store does not know are dropped silently, so a newer page cannot 400
    against an older server (see `TASK_FIELDS`).

    `created_at` is written once and then never moves — it is the row's `at` on
    the List and the Board, and a draft that jumped to the top of Upcoming on
    every keystroke would be a row that will not sit still. Answers
    `(record, canonical_id)`: the stored record (None when the write was a
    delete) and the id it is actually stored under, which is `ident` on every
    ordinary write and somebody else's id when this write was folded into a
    draft that already held its session (below). The caller has to pass that id
    back to the page, or the next autosave, the Discard and the Schedule all aim
    at a record that is no longer there.

    ONE BOUND DRAFT PER SESSION, enforced here rather than trusted to the
    client (review, 2026-09-12). A session-bound draft stands in for its
    session's row (`_bound_chips` in routers/tasks.py) and that row wears
    exactly one `✎ Draft` chip, so two drafts naming the same session is not
    two facts, it is one fact written twice.

    IT IS A MERGE AND NOT AN EVICTION (Bugbot, PR #1126, 2026-09-12). The first
    version of this rule deleted the loser, which is correct only if the winner
    is the better-informed of the two — and the write that collides is by
    construction the one that knows LESS. `fetchDrafts` never rejects: a lookup
    that fails on the way into the hop reads as "this session has no form", so
    the card mints a NEW id and saves a fresh form over a stored draft carrying
    a time, a repeat rule, a model and a tray. Evicting there threw all of that
    away over one failed GET. Folding the incoming write into the existing
    record instead (`_fold_into_bound`) makes a failed lookup cost nothing: the
    words land, the settings stay, the id the reader keeps is the one that was
    already bound. Done inside THIS write's lock rather than as a second
    request, so nothing can observe the moment two drafts both claim one
    session.

    `if_version` is the caller's `If-Match`, compared inside the lock against
    the record under THIS id (the one the caller named and is holding a version
    of). Mismatch raises `VersionConflict` and writes nothing; `None` writes
    unconditionally, which is what every client that predates versions does.

    `client`/`seq` are the page's own sequence for `draft:<id>` — the listing's
    key for this record, and the same one the client's syncer counts under

    THE VERB THE TASK'S OWN DELETE AND ERASE SPEND (Akshil, 2026-09-15;
    design.md, PR C). A session-bound draft is the NEXT MESSAGE of one
    conversation — it stands in for no row of its own, it borrows that
    conversation's number, and the only way back into it is the composer of the
    chat it is a message to. Take the task away and the draft is bytes nothing
    can show and nobody can reach, which is precisely what the chat draft beside
    it has always been treated as.

    THIS REPLACES THE UNBINDING THAT USED TO HAPPEN ON ERASE. That rule kept the
    words and cut only the binding, so the form came back as an ordinary
    `draft:<id>` row in its own folder — defensible in the abstract and wrong in
    practice, because what came back was half a message addressed to a
    conversation that no longer exists, in a lane the reader had just cleared.
    Delete and erase now do the same thing to both halves of "this session's
    unsent text", which is also the one thing they could never previously agree
    on (design.md, PR C: "Delete + erase drop BOTH").

    THE KEYS AND NOT A COUNT (bugbot, PR #1126): those rows have just left the
    listing and the caller has to announce them (`tasks_watch.notify`), or a
    page holding one goes on drawing a draft whose Schedule would send its
    message into a conversation that is gone. A count cannot be announced.

    ARCHIVE DOES NOT CALL THIS, and that is the decision this verb exists
    alongside (Akshil, 2026-09-15): filing a task away is reversible, so its
    drafts simply hide with it and come back on unarchive.

    One pass under one lock, and `[]` — no write at all — for the overwhelmingly
    common case where nothing was bound to that session."""
