"""Install and refresh the PUBLISHED ``fusedio/fused-render`` plugin in the
user's own Claude Code config (D492), so the skills reach sessions fused-render
did not launch — and so the user can SEE them.

This replaces the file copy this module used to be (``user_skills.py``, D185:
copy ``skills/<name>/`` into ``<CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR>/skills/``). The job is
unchanged — cover the user's own ``claude``, in a terminal or in their app
folder, which ``--plugin-dir`` cannot reach because that flag only exists on the
processes we spawn ourselves. What changed is the mechanism, and it changed for a
reason the copy could never satisfy: a user who could not get a chat session to
know about ``fused.ai`` went looking on the Claude Config page — Marketplaces,
Plugins, Skills — and found nothing registered. A marketplace plugin is a thing
that page already lists, that ``claude plugin list`` already reports, that the
user can update, disable, or remove on their own terms. Loose marker-guarded
directories are none of those.

**We never enable, and never re-enable.** ``enabledPlugins`` carrying an explicit
``false`` for our id is the user having said no, and it ends this module's
involvement: no install, no marketplace add, no update, nothing. An absent key is
not a no — it is a machine that has never seen this plugin, which is what an
install is for.

**Nothing here is load-bearing, and it must not be.** The sessions fused-render
spawns get their skills from ``skill_plugin.py``'s locally assembled root, passed
as ``claude --plugin-dir`` from the installed wheel (D216). That path is offline,
synchronous, version-matched, and completely independent of everything below —
which is what makes it safe for this module to be a best-effort network call that
may fail, be rate-limited, be declined by the user, or never run at all. A
disabled plugin does not weaken a fused-render chat session by one skill.

Everything is best-effort and nothing raises: callers are server startup, where a
failure to reach GitHub may not fail the app.
