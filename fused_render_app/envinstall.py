"""The project-venv install loader for the fused engine (SPEC PY-18).

A script in a folder with no `pyproject.toml` runs on the app's own interpreter
and installs nothing (PY-17). A folder that DOES declare `[project].dependencies`
— geotiff's imagecodecs and pyproj, pano's py360convert, the pandocs, and since
D276 the geo stacks of `map`, `vector` and `geometry_editor`, and
`pdf_studio`'s pymupdf/pikepdf — needs a
real download, and `fused.runPython` has roughly a 30-second budget. A build
that overruns it used to surface as a timeout or an opaque `EngineError` with
the resolver's real complaint buried inside, which is the worst possible answer
to "you need a package you don't have".

So the build moves off the request path entirely, in the shape
`templates/docs/install_worker.py` already uses for the typst download (one
pattern in this repo, not two):

  1. `/api/run` pre-flight: project declared + venv absent or stale ->
     `needs_install` with the venv key and the project. Nothing blocks.
  2. `POST /api/env/install` -> `start()` spawns a **detached** worker
     (`_env_install_worker.py`) that runs `uv sync` and writes `progress.json`.
  3. `GET /api/env/progress?key=` -> `progress()`, polled by the page shell.
  4. `POST /api/env/cancel` -> `cancel()`, by the pid the worker recorded.

Two things this module must never get wrong:

**The key is the project folder's, and it is OURS.** `venv_key_for` delegates to
`projectenv`, which hashes the folder's absolute path; where the venv itself
lives is `projectenv.venv_dir_for`'s call, not this module's or the backend's —
`<project_dir>/.venv` for a folder this app can write to, `<home_dir()>/venvs/
<key>` for one it cannot (a read-only in-package runner folder, an unwritable
mount, `FUSED_RENDER_VENV_IN_TREE=0`). That is why nothing here reaches for
upstream's `_venvs_path` any more, and why the split does not matter to it: we
build the environment with `uv sync` and hand the resulting interpreter to the
backend as `interpreter=`, so upstream never has to agree with us about a
directory, in either case. What it DOES still have to agree with us about is
the base interpreter (`_python_executable`), and that one attribute is still
read off the live backend rather than restated.

**Errors are verbatim.** uv's own stderr is written into `progress.json`
unchanged. "No solution found ... imagecodecs has no wheels with a matching
platform tag" is the whole reason this flow is visible; a generic message would
leave the user exactly where they started.

Progress granularity is deliberately coarse. `uv sync` runs behind
`capture_output=True`, so its per-package progress cannot be streamed;
`STAGES` names what is actually observable and nothing here invents a
percentage implying more resolution than that.

Scope is **per-folder** (SPEC PY-16), which is the sharing D173 deferred: one
venv per project root, shared by every `.py` under it however deep. A page
calling five scripts from one project installs once.

    `interpreter` is what the backend should be given: **None means "ours"**, the

    key it produces today. `ready` is False only when this machine has no usable
    3.12 yet and one has to be downloaded before anything can be keyed at all.

    The order is deliberate:

    1. **An explicit override**, probed. Same contract as
       `engine._APP_PYTHON_ENV`: an override that is not a usable 3.12 is a
       misconfiguration to refuse, not a reason to build on it.
    2. **Ourselves, when we are already 3.12** — and this is the common path, not a
       shortcut. All three packaged builds run 3.12 (the DMG's `python@3.12`, the
       AppImage's and the Windows installer's `uv python install 3.12`), and so does
       a `scripts/dev.sh` checkout since D214. Resolving a uv-MANAGED 3.12 for them
       instead would re-key every venv they own and download a second CPython to
       reach a version they already had: `uv python find --managed-python` only
       matches uv's own registry, and every bundled 3.12 is copied into the payload
       rather than registered there.
    3. **A uv-managed 3.12**, probed. This is the path that fixes the reported bug —
       a server on 3.14 built every script venv on cp314, so a script wanting
       tensorflow (no cp314 wheels) was an unresolvable dead end that no rebuild
       could repair. Managed only: no Homebrew, no system python, no PATH search,
       because the point is a known interpreter rather than whichever 3.12 a machine
       happens to have.
    4. **No uv at all -> ours, unpinned, and no project venv is possible.** A
       source checkout without uv cannot find or fetch a managed anything, so
       there is nothing to pin to. This still answers READY, and deliberately so:
       readiness is about the interpreter, and every script whose folder declares
       no `pyproject.toml` runs fine on ours (PY-17) — which is most of them.
       What such a machine cannot do any more is BUILD a project venv, because
       `uv sync` is the builder (D231). That is reported by the worker, in those
       words, at the point it is actually true; refusing here would take the

      False — DEFINITE evidence there is no usable interpreter here: the probe
              completed with a non-zero exit, or the spawn failed on the exe
              itself (`FileNotFoundError`/`PermissionError`/`NotADirectoryError`).
      None  — INCONCLUSIVE: we could not complete the probe. A timeout, any
              other `OSError` — `EAGAIN` (cannot fork under load), `EMFILE` (the
              server is out of descriptors), `EINTR` — or a child KILLED BY A
              SIGNAL. None of those are facts about the venv, and the caller
              must not act on them.

    The two-valued version of this was a real hazard, not a hypothetical:
    `subprocess.TimeoutExpired` IS a `SubprocessError` and the budget is 5s, so a
    handful of concurrent `/api/run` calls on a loaded machine was enough to
    unlink the ready marker of a perfectly healthy venv and charge the user a full
    uv re-download for it. `engine._probe` is the precedent — it reports a failed
    probe and destroys nothing.

    `-c ""` deliberately: the question is not "are the requirements importable"
    (that is upstream's job and would cost a real import) but the far more basic
    "does this interpreter reach the point of executing a program". A venv whose
    `home`/base prefix no longer exists dies before that — in the DMG case with
    `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'encodings'` or a bare fatal error — so
    the emptiest possible program is a complete test of the property that broke.

    Run with `PYTHONHOME`/`PYTHONPATH`/`VIRTUAL_ENV`/`PYTHONSTARTUP` scrubbed,
    borrowed from `engine._child_env()` rather than restated here: that is derived
    from `python_compute._STRIPPED_ENV_VARS` when fused is importable, so the probe
    cannot drift from the environment the child actually gets. Running it with OUR
    env is the whole reason the bug was invisible — inside the .app, PYTHONHOME is
    set and makes a broken venv look fine (build_dmg.sh's smokes made the same

    The ceiling this guarantees: at most ONE probe per venv per server process,
    and NEVER one per request. `/api/run`'s pre-flight calls `is_installed` on
    every run of every PEP 723 script, so an unmemoized probe would put a
    subprocess spawn on the request path of the app's hottest execution path —
    which is precisely the cost the install loader exists to remove.

    Double-checked locking: read the cache under the lock, probe OUTSIDE it, then
    re-acquire to store. The lock is module-global, so holding it across the probe
    (as this first did, copying `engine._app_interpreter_lock`'s shape) serialized
    the first probes of completely UNRELATED venvs — and with a 5s budget, one venv
    whose directory sits on a wedged network mount then blocked every
    `is_installed` in the process for up to five seconds, cached hits for healthy
    venvs included. Clicking through eight PEP 723 pages is eight first-probes, and
    the tail is what hurts, not the ~15-30ms each.

    The cost of the looser lock is that two threads racing on the SAME venv can
    both probe. That is accepted deliberately: the probe is a read-only `-c ""`
    with no side effects, so a duplicate costs one extra spawn in a rare race —
    a much better trade than a global stall. If the other thread stored a verdict
    while we were probing, theirs wins and ours is discarded, so every caller in
    the race still sees ONE answer.

    Probing outside the lock also means the venv can be DESTROYED mid-probe, so the
    generation is read before the probe and re-checked after (`_generation_of`), and
    the invariant is absolute: **a verdict is only ever cached against the generation
    it judged.** If it moved, this returns its own measurement to its own caller and
    stores nothing — no window in which the cache describes a venv that is gone, and
    nothing for `_REBUILD_ATTEMPTED` to have to absorb.

    Negative verdicts are cached too — and `is_installed` drops the entry whenever
    the marker is absent, which is what stops a cached "no" from outliving the
    venv it judged. See the comment there.

    An INCONCLUSIVE probe (`None`) is deliberately not cached: it says nothing
    about the venv, so there is nothing to remember, and caching it would turn one
    unlucky fork under load into a permanently unvalidated venv. `_VALIDATED` maps

    The ready marker is the INDEX of installed venvs — the only thing consulted to
    find one, and its absence is final — but since D212 it is treated as a *claim*
    that gets verified once per process rather than as proof. The macOS DMG is why:
    its bundled interpreter could not self-locate without PYTHONHOME, which
    `python_compute` strips from every child, so a venv built from it recorded a
    base prefix that does not exist on the user's machine and every child of that
    venv died. And the venv cache key is the project folder's path — a constant
    across app upgrades — so upgrading the app did not change
    the key, nothing ever revalidated, and the breakage was permanent with no
    repair action anywhere in the UI. `Contents/lib -> Resources/lib`
    (`scripts/build_dmg.sh`) stops NEW venvs from being built that way; this stops
    an EXISTING bad one from being trusted forever.

    Two guarantees bound what that costs when it is wrong, both pinned by tests:
    the probe is three-valued, so an INCONCLUSIVE result (`_venv_runs` -> None:
    a timeout, a fork that failed under load) answers True and touches nothing;
    and the repair is attempted at most ONCE per venv per process, so a venv that
    cannot be fixed by rebuilding stops asking to be rebuilt. Both are contracts,
    not defensive padding — see the comments at each branch below.

    And ONE rule covers every branch that acts on a verdict: **a verdict may only be
    acted on while the generation it judged is still current, and a "ready" answer
    requires the marker to still be there at the moment we answer.** The probe is a
    subprocess, so between stamping the marker and answering, the install worker (a
    different PROCESS) can un-mark this venv, rebuild it, and re-mark it — none of
    which touches `_GENERATION`/`_EPOCH`, because those only know what THIS process
    did. That asymmetry is why both mechanisms exist: the counters keep the cache
    honest about our own discards, and the marker stamp keeps us honest about
    everyone else's. So the stamp is captured before the probe and re-checked, by
    IDENTITY not existence, before either answer that depends on it.

    Detached so the build outlives the request that started it and any page
    reload — but on POSIX the CHILD is what detaches itself, with `os.setsid()`
    as the first statement of `_env_install_worker.main`, rather than this
    Popen passing `start_new_session=True`.

    **That split is the whole point, and it is D277's crash one layer down.**
    `start_new_session` forces CPython off `posix_spawn` and onto `fork()+exec`
    (see `subprocess.Popen._execute_child`: the fast path requires
    `not close_fds and not start_new_session`), and this spawn happens in the
    SERVER process, where PROJ is resident — so `fork()` ran PROJ's
    `pthread_atfork` child handler, which `sqlite3_close()`s a handle that is no
    longer valid, and the worker took SIGSEGV at ~1ms, before exec.

    The user-visible shape of that is worth naming, because it is deliberately
    hard to read: the worker dies before it can write ANYTHING, so `worker.log`
    is empty, `progress.json` still holds the parent's `spawn` record, and
    `_crash_diagnosis` reports an installer that "was killed rather than
    failing". The install never started, the page retries, and it fails again
    the same way for as long as the server process lives — which for a runner
    environment (`fused_render_app.ai.supervisor._ensure_venv`) means a model that
    can never be loaded.

    `close_fds=False` is what puts this on `posix_spawn`, and it costs nothing:
    every fd Python opens is non-inheritable by default (PEP 446), so the
    detached worker inherits the log file it is given and not the server's
    sockets. `os.setsid()` in the child then restores everything
    `start_new_session` bought — a session and process group of its own, so
    `_kill`'s `killpg` reaches the `uv` it is waiting on, and so a terminal
    signal aimed at the server does not take the download with it. The window
    between exec and that call is a few milliseconds, and `_kill` already
    handles a pid that is not (yet) a group leader.

    Windows keeps `DETACHED_PROCESS | CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP`: there is no
    fork there, so there is nothing to avoid, and `CTRL_BREAK_EVENT` (which
    `_kill` sends) needs the group flag.

    Every path the worker needs travels in argv rather than being re-derived
    there, because the worker must not import `fused_render_app` (D152: importing the
    package in a detached child is a bootstrap that broke once already) and so
    cannot call `projectenv` itself. Two independent derivations of the venv
    directory is exactly how a loader ends up filling a directory no run reads.

    The uv cache slot (4) carries the SAME empty-string-means-None idiom slots
    5 and 6 use, for the same reason: `projectenv.uv_cache_dir()` answers
    `None` — "let uv pick its own default" — whenever `FUSED_RENDER_HOME` is
    not set, which argv cannot carry directly. See that function for why an
    explicit sibling cache is no longer the unconditional default.

    Slot 5 is the base interpreter — `uv sync --python`. The backend's
    `_python_executable()` rather than the worker's own `sys.executable`: the
    backend runs the code, so its interpreter and the environment's have to be
    one choice. argv cannot carry None, so the empty string stands for it and the
    worker falls back to its OWN `sys.executable` — deliberately not to the pinned
    `SCRIPT_PYTHON_VERSION`. Passing the version string where uv expects an
    interpreter was a real bug once; see the worker's `_PINNED_PYTHON_VERSION`
    (D214).

    `acquire_python` (slot 6, same empty-string-means-nothing idiom) asks the worker
    to DOWNLOAD that Python version and stop, rather than build a venv (D214). It
    cannot do both in one run: the interpreter is reported under
    `PYTHON_BOOTSTRAP_KEY` and the packages under the project's own key, and one
    worker reports under one key.

    Slot 7 is `allow_build`, `"1"` or `""` — whether a dependency with no
    matching wheel may fall back to building from source (see `_build`'s
    `--no-build`). Off by default: a source build runs code the manifest never
    named as a dependency (the package's own build backend), and the whole
    point of the install-consent prompt this feeds is that nothing runs
    without being asked first. The one caller allowed to set it True is
    `/api/env/install`'s retry after the resolver's own no-wheel error —
    `runtime.js` re-prompts naming the specific package before making it.

    Install may navigate away, close its tab, or simply be a page whose script called
    `envinstall.start` through some path with no loader UI of its own at all
    (`ai/supervisor.py` is exactly that). A report driven by the PAGE cannot
    cover any of those: the moment its document goes away, the row the jobs
    dock already understands as "stalled" (`jobs.py`'s `STALE_AFTER_S`) is
    what a page-driven report would produce — which is precisely the case
    this dock exists to make visible instead of hiding.

    So the SERVER mirrors it, in a short daemon thread reading `progress(key)`
    on a plain poll loop and writing what it sees into `jobs.upsert(...,
    server=True)` under a deterministic id (`sys:env-install:<key>`) — a
    `sys:` id because the row belongs to a build THIS PROCESS is running, not
    to whichever page happened to trigger it (jobs.py's OWNER_SERVER: the
    dock's ✕ becomes a real cancel, not a request the reporter might ignore).

    The thread is the STOP condition's owner too: it exits the moment
    `progress(key)` reports `done`, and on the way there, it is what turns a
    press of the dock's own ✕ (`jobs.request_cancel`, read back as
    `cancel_requested` on the record `upsert` returns) into the SAME
    `envinstall.cancel(key)` the loader's own Cancel button calls — one
    cancellation path for both surfaces, rather than the dock's ✕ silently
    doing nothing because nothing downstream ever reads it.

    ONE THREAD PER CLAIM, not per job id: because the job id is deterministic
    per key, a retry landing inside this thread's own poll window reuses it
    while THIS thread is still running — `start()` unlinks `progress.json`
    and takes over the claim before spawning the new worker and starting a
    second `_mirror_into_jobs`. This thread captures the claim's own content
    (`_claim_token`, above) the moment it starts, and every tick reconfirms
    the claim on disk still matches before touching the row at all. The
    retry's takeover unlinks-and-recreates the claim, so the instant that
    happens this thread's token check fails and it steps aside quietly —
    no upsert, no cancel — leaving the row to the NEW thread the retry
    started, which opens with its own fresh upsert. Two threads never both
    drive the row: the loser of the token check ends before it would have
    read the stale synthetic "spawn" record `progress()` hands out for the
    new claim, which is what used to keep it looping alongside the new
    thread believing nothing had finished yet.

    The SAME reuse is why a stale `cancel_requested` cannot survive to the
    new attempt on its own: `jobs.upsert`'s state-transition rule only clears
    it on a transition INTO a terminal state, so a mirror thread that never
    got there (this thread's own `jobs.upsert` calls are best-effort) can
    leave the row `running` with the flag still set for the next attempt to
    inherit. The opening `jobs.clear_cancel_requested` call below disowns
    that inherited flag right after the opening upsert, on every attempt —
    a ✕ pressed after that point still sets it normally, through the same
    `jobs.request_cancel` the dock always used.

    Best-effort throughout: a `jobs.upsert` failure must never take the
    install down with it, only leave its dock row missing or stale for one
    tick — which the dock already renders honestly.

    `downloading_python` is `start()`'s own `acquire_python` flag, one call
    earlier: D214's bootstrap round reports under `PYTHON_BOOTSTRAP_KEY`
    rather than the project's venv key, and `_mirror_into_jobs` runs once
    for THAT round and again, separately, for the packages round that
    follows once the interpreter is pinned — two real rows for two real
    downloads, under two different job ids (the key differs), so this is not
    the duplicate-row problem `report_job=False` exists to fix. But both
    rounds used to share the SAME title, `f"Preparing {display_name}"` —
    which reads as a bug (a row that finishes and appears to instantly start
    over) rather than as two distinct pieces of work, and round 1's title
    was also wrong on its own terms: it is downloading a Python interpreter,
    not preparing the project. `downloading_python=True` gives it a title

          user_confirmed_build: bool = False) -> dict:
    """Begin (or join) the install for `project_dir`; returns its progress.

    `report_job=False` opts out of `_mirror_into_jobs`'s generic
    `sys:env-install:<key>` jobs-dock row for a caller that already mirrors
    this exact install into its OWN row. `ai/supervisor.py` is that caller: an
    AI model's first load reports its bring-up under `job_id_for(model)` —
    same `uv sync`, titled with the model and carrying its own richer
    "Preparing X — installing…" detail — and without this flag the user saw
    TWO jobs-dock rows for one thing happening the moment a model needed its
    environment built. Default True: every other caller (the loader's own
    `/api/env/install`) has no row of its own for this key, so the generic
    mirror is the only one there ever is.

    `allow_build` reaches the worker only on the branch that actually spawns
    one — a caller that joins an install already running, or finds one already
    done, has no say over a `uv sync` invocation that either already happened
    or is somebody else's; the flag only ever governed on the FIRST call for a
    key. Default False, matching `_build`'s: every existing caller (the
    bundled AI runners, through `ai/supervisor.py`) keeps its `--no-build`
    behaviour unchanged, and the one caller that means to allow a source build
    (`/api/env/install`'s explicit retry, after the resolver's own no-wheel
    error) says so. A runner can also reach `allow_build=True` DECLARATIVELY —
    `[tool.fused-render.runner] allow_build = true` in its own manifest, read
    by `ai/supervisor.py._ensure_venv` via `projectenv.runner_allows_build` —
    on every automatic load, with no click at all; that is a separate thing
    from `user_confirmed_build` below and must not be conflated with it.

    `user_confirmed_build` governs ONLY the poisoned-record short-circuit
    below, and is deliberately a SEPARATE parameter from `allow_build`: the
    two answer different questions. `allow_build` says "may this attempt
    build from source" (a fact about the manifest or the click, forwarded to
    the worker); `user_confirmed_build` says "did an actual human just click
    'install anyway' on THIS call" (a one-time action that justifies
    distrusting a stale terminal verdict). `/api/env/install`'s retry sets
    both from the same request field, because for that caller they really are
    the same event. `ai/supervisor.py._ensure_venv` sets only `allow_build`
    (from the runner's manifest) and leaves `user_confirmed_build` at its
    default False — a folder's own `pyproject.toml` declaring it wants to
    build is a standing declaration, not a one-time click, and the two must
    not be conflated even though a run with `allow_build=True` can never
    actually reach the record this parameter guards (see that guard's own
    comment below for why, and for the honest account of what this
    parameter does and does not prevent).

    Idempotent in the two ways that matter: already installed is a no-op, and an
    install already running is joined rather than duplicated. Two workers running
    `uv sync` into one venv directory is a race nothing else covers — the loser
    dies on a half-built `<venv>/bin/python`.

    The returned record says which of the two happened: `claimed` is True only
    for the call that spawned the installer (see `_reported`). A joiner must not
    cancel what it merely joined, and the key cannot tell it apart.

    Keyed on the PROJECT, so this is also what makes a page calling five scripts
    from one folder install once: all five resolve to the same key, the first
    claims it and the other four join. (The client dedups too — see
    `runtime.js`'s `installEnv` registry — but that is about not issuing five
    POSTs; this is what makes five POSTs harmless if they arrive anyway.)

    When this machine has no pinned Python yet (D214) the FIRST thing installed is
    that interpreter, under `PYTHON_BOOTSTRAP_KEY` — every step below is written
    against a key rather than against a venv, so the claim, the join, the spawn
    record and the polling all apply unchanged. The client then re-runs, the
    interpreter resolves, and this function is called again for the packages
    themselves. Two visible rounds, because they are two downloads.

    # `[tool.fused-render.runner]` table changes the manifest bytes
    # `projectenv.state_digest` hashes, which is exactly what
