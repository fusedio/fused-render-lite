"""Background apps (fused.daemon): a .fused app can declare a long-running
daemon that this server supervises — single instance, the app's own venv,
killed with the server. Copied from fused-render's `background_apps.py`; the
only Render App changes are the import swaps noted inline (see engine_host.py's
`Child.folder` and background_routes.py).

A folder opts in with a manifest table in its own `pyproject.toml`, declaring
exactly one of two protocols:

    [tool.fused-render.app]
    daemon = "daemon.py"   # your own HTTP surface; resident by default

    [tool.fused-render.app]
    main = "compute.py"    # the shipped worker calls main(**params); reaped
                           # after DEFAULT_MAIN_IDLE_TIMEOUT_S idle seconds

`idle_timeout_s` overrides that per-protocol default; `0` means resident
(never reaped). Either filename is resolved inside the folder, following
registered_apps.py's containment-guard style: a value that resolves outside
the folder (e.g. via `../`) is refused rather than trusted.

Run state and autostart are two independent, orthogonal things (D511, code
review that produced this module's current shape): whether the daemon is
alive RIGHT NOW is `engine_host`'s own live-child bookkeeping, while
autostart is only "should the server bring this up at every launch" — a
persisted opt-in flag, and nothing else. The autostart store
(`<home_dir()>/background_apps.json`) is that sticky "bring this back at
startup" list, following registered_apps.py's read/write discipline: a
folder that is temporarily missing or unreadable drops out of
`autostart_paths()` (read-only — it may come back), and only `set_autostart`
rewrites the store. **Autostart is opt-in and starting an app never touches
it** — `background_routes.py`'s `start` endpoint spawns a
daemon without persisting anything; only an explicit `autostart` call (or a
direct `set_autostart(path, True)`) turns the flag on. `resurrect_autostart`
(the startup hook) only ever brings up paths explicitly present in the
store.

    that in-place rewrite the same way it already catches a daemon.py edit.

    Raises OSError if the manifest is missing/invalid, the daemon file does
