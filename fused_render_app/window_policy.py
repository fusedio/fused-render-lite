"""Navigation and download policy for the app's native windows.

Pure Python, no AppKit: `mainwindow.py` asks these functions what to do with
a navigation WebKit is about to perform and enacts the answer. Keeping the
decisions here means they run under pytest on every platform, while the
AppKit half is only ever imported inside the packaged macOS app.

A URL is one of three kinds relative to the server this process owns:

- ``"app"``       loopback, our port — the placeholder, an `/open` page, a
                  raw-file URL. Loads inside a window.
- ``"external"``  any other http(s) — the default browser's job.
- ``"other"``     anything else (about:blank, data:, blob:, javascript:).
                  Left to WebKit; never bounced out of the process.
