"""A floor engine that reads an app folder and flags the obvious problems
worth failing a push over — a leaked credential, a path that only resolves
on the machine it was written on, and an app folder missing the four files
that make a share openable, recognizable, and reproducible for whoever
receives it: `index.html`, a README, a `preview.png` thumbnail, and a
`pyproject.toml` declaring its dependencies.

Judging whether an app's `fused.*` calls are actually correct is not this
script's job: that question needs to know whether a name is being used
correctly, not just whether it exists, and telling those apart is a job for
the skill that reads and greps the app directly
(skills/fused-render-app-doctor/SKILL.md) rather than a fixed pattern match.

This script is a file the fused-render-app-doctor skill writes, verbatim,
into whatever repo an app lives in, at `.github/app_check.py`, alongside the
workflow at `.github/workflows/app-check.yml` that runs it on every push (see
that skill's SKILL.md for the setup procedure and app-check.yml for the loop
over a repo's app folders). Its job is a floor that fails a push on an
obvious problem — a strict, deliberate SUBSET of what the skill's own review
covers, not a substitute for it.

STDLIB ONLY. It runs on every push in a plain GitHub Actions runner, with
nothing installed beyond the standard library — no import can add a
dependency, a network call, or a wait for anything to install.

FINDINGS ARE MASKED AT THE SOURCE. They end up in CI logs and chat
transcripts a person did not choose to keep secret, so `check()` never
returns an excerpt containing a whole matched secret — see `_mask` and the
assertion in tests/test_app_doctor.py. A device path or a structural gap is
left as-is: neither is a secret, and showing it whole is what makes the
finding actionable.

NOT EVERY FINDING FAILS THE RUN — CANDIDATES REPORT, FACTS FAIL. This script
used to treat every finding as the same flat "high" severity, on the theory
that everything it reports is worth failing a push over. That theory does not
survive contact with a real workspace: a run of this exact engine over the 8
apps in a real `~/Fused/local` produced 40 content findings and every single
one was a false positive — 26 were the same absolute path repeated across
committed `runs/*.json` logs, 6 were `/tmp/xxx` inside a vendored stdlib
module's docstrings, 5 were paths inside markdown code spans (a backtick used
to count as an opening quote), 2 were a deliberate `SKIP_DIRS` constant and a
relative URL in test HTML, and 1 was a fixture's obviously-fake password. The
secrets and device-path families are pattern matches over arbitrary text —
they locate CANDIDATES, and only a read of the surrounding file decides
whether one is real, which is exactly the judgment `SKILL.md` exists to make.
Failing a push on a candidate alone means a false positive blocks a real
commit; that cost model is upside down for these two families.
`CHECK_META` (below) marks `secrets` and `device-paths` as `kind: "candidate"`
and everything else — the four structure gaps — `kind: "fact"`: a missing
`index.html`/README/`preview.png`/`pyproject.toml` is not a pattern match
over prose, it is a direct `os.path.isfile` answer with no false-positive
rate at all. `main`
exits 1 only when a fact finding fired; a run with candidates only prints them
and exits 0, so someone still sees them without a push getting blocked over
a maybe.

BUT NOT EVERY FACT SHOULD BLOCK EITHER. A missing `preview.png`
(`structure:missing-thumbnail`) is a fact — `os.path.isfile` said so with no
ambiguity — yet its severity is `suggested`: the share still opens and works
without a thumbnail, it just looks worse in a listing. Gating the exit code
on `kind == "fact"` alone made that cosmetic gap fail the same build a leaked
AWS key (`secrets`, `severity: "critical"`, but `kind: "candidate"` so it
never blocked) would exit 0 on — inverted urgency, not merely inconsistent.
`main` now exits 1 only for a FACT finding whose severity is `critical` or
`warning`; a `suggested` fact still prints (it is real and worth fixing) but
never reddens the build on its own, and a candidate — any severity — never
blocks, per the paragraph above.

WORKING TREE ONLY. No history scan — a secret already committed is a job for
whatever gates publishing, not this script, and scanning history would make
every run as slow as the app's oldest commit.

Run as `python app_check.py [path]` (path defaults to `.`): prints one
`path:line: rule: excerpt` line per finding, then exits 1 if any FACT finding
of severity `critical` or `warning` fired, 0 otherwise (a clean folder, only
candidates, or only `suggested` facts).

# machine mounted it, under whatever name). A path under one of these always
# fires.
#
# WEAK roots are shared OS directories that hold both personal AND purely
# system content — `/var/log`, `/tmp` used as a generic scratch dir,
# `/private/var/vm` on macOS. Firing on the bare root alone produces exactly
# the false positives measured against a real workspace: `/private/var/vm`
# inside a deliberate `SKIP_DIRS` constant, and `/media/cover.png`, a
# relative URL sitting in test HTML. So a weak root only fires when the path
# continues PAST a bare OS-jargon directory name into something that reads as
# user- or project-specific — see `_is_weak_device_root_false_positive`.
