"""Detached worker that builds one project venv, spawned by envinstall.start().

Run as:  python _env_install_worker.py <key> <progress_dir> <project_dir>
                                      <venv_dir> <uv_cache_dir>
                                      <python_executable> <acquire_python>

Every path arrives in argv rather than being derived here, because this file
must stay free of any `fused_render_app` import (D152 — importing the package in a
detached child is a bootstrap that broke once already) and so cannot call
`projectenv`. Re-deriving the venv directory would also be a second derivation
of a cache key, which is how a loader ends up filling a directory no run reads.

`<uv_cache_dir>` is EMPTY, same idiom, whenever `envinstall._spawn` was handed
`projectenv.uv_cache_dir() is None` — which is the ordinary case now, not the
exception: `_build` then runs `uv sync` with no `UV_CACHE_DIR` override at all,
deferring to uv's OWN default (XDG on Linux, `~/.cache/uv` on macOS too —
NOT `~/Library/Caches`, `%LOCALAPPDATA%` on Windows) instead of an explicit
sibling of the venv store — and to whatever `UV_CACHE_DIR` is already
AMBIENT in this process's own environment, if one is: `_uv_env`'s base is a
plain copy of `os.environ`, so a value set by the shell, or by CI's own
`setup-uv` action, rides along untouched rather than being stripped, which
would be imposing a different cache choice of our own. That explicit
sibling used to be unconditional and fragmented per branch/worktree as a
result — see `projectenv.uv_cache_dir()` for the history and the trade this
accepts (giving up the one-filesystem hardlink guarantee everywhere the two
happen to already coincide, to stop a guaranteed multi-gigabyte redownload
everywhere they used to differ). An explicit path still arrives when the
caller set `FUSED_RENDER_HOME` — not only the test suite's own isolation,
but also the packaged Linux/Windows desktop app, which sets it
unconditionally for every launch (`supervisor.paths.DesktopPaths`, D131).

`<python_executable>` is the base interpreter the environment is built on, and it
must be the value `envinstall._python_executable()` returned — the backend runs
the code, so its interpreter and the environment's have to be one choice. argv
cannot carry None, so the EMPTY STRING stands for it; `install` is the one place
that mapping happens, and it maps to this worker's OWN `sys.executable` (see
`_PINNED_PYTHON_VERSION` for why not a version string).

`<acquire_python>` (same empty-string idiom) switches this worker to its OTHER job:
DOWNLOAD that Python version, report it, and stop without building anything (D214).
The two cannot be one run — the interpreter is reported under
`envinstall.PYTHON_BOOTSTRAP_KEY` and the packages under the project's own key,
and one worker reports under one key.

Reports through `<progress_dir>/progress.json` — the same
`{stage, pct, detail, done, error, pid, ts}` record
`fused_render_app/templates/docs/install_worker.py` writes for the typst download,
so the page shell polls one shape.

Three deliberate choices:

**It builds with `uv sync`, in the project directory** (or, when that directory
cannot be written to, in a manifest-only mirror of it beside the venv — see
`_sync_root`, and note that the bundled AI runner folders are read-only on the
packaged builds). The declaration is the
folder's `pyproject.toml`; `uv sync` is the command that turns one into an
environment, resolves it, and writes the `uv.lock` the user commits. It is
pointed at `<venv_dir>` through `UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT` rather than trusting
uv's own default resolution of that path — `<venv_dir>` arrived in argv already
computed by `projectenv.venv_dir_for`, which puts it INSIDE the folder for one
this app can write to (`<project_dir>/.venv`, the common case now) and under
our own home dir for one it cannot (a read-only in-package runner folder, an
unwritable mount, `FUSED_RENDER_VENV_IN_TREE=0`) — and at a cache on the same
filesystem through `UV_CACHE_DIR` whenever the caller asked for one, which is
what lets uv hardlink wheels instead of silently copying them. `UV_LINK_MODE`
is deliberately left UNSET — uv's default already prefers hardlinks and falls
back on its own.

**The ready marker and the source sidecar are written HERE, in that order.**
The sidecar records what the venv was built from and is what makes a later
declaration edit detectable; writing it after the marker would leave a window in
which the venv reads as installed but cannot say what it holds. An unmarked
directory is half-built and is removed before syncing, which is what makes
D212's repair a real replacement rather than a reconcile in place.

**Its error text is uv's, unedited.** uv's stderr goes into `progress.json`
verbatim, because a resolver failure ("no wheels with a matching platform tag
for imagecodecs") is the actual answer the user needs — the whole reason this
install is a visible flow instead of a 30-second timeout inside /api/run.

Stdlib only: no `fused_render_app` import, and (since the switch to `uv sync`) no
`fused` import either. It runs on whatever `sys.executable` the server used.

# whenever the server is already on the pinned version, which is every packaged
# build (the DMG's `python@3.12`, the AppImage's and the Windows installer's
# `uv python install 3.12`) and every `scripts/dev.sh` checkout since D214.
#
# Translating that None into the literal "3.12" was a real bug: `uv sync --python

# bundled app interpreter, and with uv's default download behaviour it fetches a
# managed CPython the app never uses as its base — so the venv is built on one
# interpreter and the code runs on another. `install` maps the empty slot to
# `sys.executable`, which IS the server's interpreter because `envinstall._spawn`
# launches this worker with it.
#
# The pin itself still exists and still matters; it lives at

#:
#: Inside the macOS .app, py2app's launcher exports `PYTHONHOME=<App>/Contents/
#: Resources`, so those build interpreters resolved their stdlib and site
#: out of the BUNDLE instead of out of the build environment. The bundle still
#: ships setuptools' `_distutils_hack` shim (py2app collects it; `build_dmg.sh`
#: prunes setuptools itself and used to leave the shim behind), so a fresh
#: setuptools' `import _distutils_hack.override` got the app's stale frozen copy,
#: which hijacked the distutils bootstrap and died with
#: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'jaraco.text'`. Every source build in
#: the packaged app failed that way — reported to the user as a runner
#: environment that "did not build" (D266).

#: which the macOS framework build sets). A union rather than a pick: each name
#: is on one of those lists because it redirects an interpreter somewhere it
#: should not go, and uv's children are interpreters.

class _UvProgress:
    """Tracks one `uv sync`'s stderr, line by line, into numbers a heartbeat
    tick can report without inventing anything uv did not say.

    **Locked, because two threads genuinely touch this concurrently**:
    `_build`'s thread calls `feed()` as it reads uv's stderr, and the
    heartbeat thread calls `snapshot()` on its own timer. An earlier version
    of this class argued that was safe WITHOUT a lock because `feed` "only
    ever adds" to `_sizes`/`_downloaded` — that argument is wrong, not just
    incomplete: CPython raises `RuntimeError` for a mutation racing an
    iteration of the SAME container, and `snapshot` iterates both
    (`sum(self._sizes.values())`, the `for name in self._downloaded` sum, and
    the `self._sizes.items()` comprehension while picking the biggest pending
    package) — confirmed empirically (`RuntimeError('Set changed size during
    iteration')` within a second of a real install). That exception escaped
    the heartbeat thread, which killed it permanently: `progress.json` (`ts`
    included) then froze for the rest of a multi-GB install — the exact
    "stuck installer" symptom this feature exists to remove, reached by a new
    path. `fused_render_app.envinstall._remember_ending` documents the same
    hazard for `_ENDINGS`: a dict `pop`/iterate pair is not atomic just
    because each single dict operation is. The fix is the same house pattern
    — one lock across every read AND write, including copies (`list(...)`/
    `frozenset(...)` still iterate the source, so the copy has to happen
    UNDER the lock too, not instead of it).

    **The announced total is a LOWER BOUND that can only grow**, never shrink
    or get corrected downward: uv prints `Downloading` lines as it starts
    each fetch, not all at once, so a later line can raise the total after an
    earlier tick already reported one. That is the same argument
    `with_heartbeat`'s docstring makes against inventing a percentage — an
    honest number that occasionally jumps up beats a smooth one that is lying
    — and it is safe here specifically because `bytes_done` is a sum over the
    same dict `bytes_total` is: a size cannot be counted as done before it is
    counted as announced, so done can never exceed total (still asserted
    below, defensively, rather than trusted).

    Package-level only — measuring the in-flight bytes of a single large
    download (the ROCm torch wheel is one ~3.4GB step here) was investigated
    and dropped; see the module the feature shipped from for why (uv's cache
    directory grows by UNPACKED size, several times the compressed download,
    with no single file to stat as "bytes so far"). A package mid-download
    therefore contributes nothing to `bytes_done` until it is confirmed
    landed — the difference this class makes is at the AGGREGATE level, where
    a 40-package venv's small packages landing one by one is now visible
    progress instead of the single flat "installing…" it used to be.

        uv stops redrawing a package's row the INSTANT it lands — it prints
        no separate confirmation under a tty the way a pipe's `Downloaded`
        line does (see `feed`'s docstring) — so a name that WAS in the
        previous frame and is gone from this one, while still short of its
        own announced total, USUALLY has finished by elimination. Confirmed
        against a real, multi-package capture: names drop out of the
        display ONE AT A TIME as each completes, not all together — except
        at the very final clear, which drops everyone remaining at once
        with no marker text of its own; `feed`'s `_PREPARED_RE` branch is
        the backstop for exactly that gap.

        **"Usually", not "always" — a vanished name can also mean DISPLACED,
        not finished.** `pty.openpty()` sets no winsize, so uv falls back to
        an 80x24 terminal and renders at most ~23 rows while downloading up
        to 50 wheels concurrently; a package still downloading simply
        scrolls out of the visible frame, and reading that as completion is
        indistinguishable from a real completion at THIS layer alone.
        Measured on a real 149-package capture: 44 names vanished from a
        frame while their last reading was under 90% of their own announced
        total (several at 0 B), and 4 of those reappeared in a LATER frame
        still downloading — 153.2 MB was credited as transferred that had
        not been, and the run reported 147.3 of 152.5 MB nowhere near done.
        `_run_uv_via_pty` now sets a tall winsize specifically so this
        should not happen in practice (uv never has a reason to clamp), but
        this method does not TRUST that — it is the second, independent
        layer: a vanished name is confirmed only when its last known
        in-flight reading was at or near its own total already
        (`_PTY_NEAR_TOTAL_FRACTION`). One that vanished well short of it is
        left exactly as it was — neither confirmed nor discarded, so its
        last-known bytes keep counting toward `done` (honest, if slightly
        stale) until it either reappears with fresh progress or the
        `Prepared` backstop confirms it. The damage of confirming wrongly
        would otherwise be PERMANENT: `feed_pty_progress` early-returns for
        any name already in `_downloaded`, so a displaced package's real
        bytes could never be counted again, and `_mark_downloaded_locked`
        would latch `phase = "preparing"` with `done == total` while
        gigabytes were still arriving — precisely the "stuck at 100%" lie
        this whole feature exists to remove, reached by a different route.

        Without this method at all, `_downloaded` gains almost no members
        under a pty: `feed_pty_progress`'s OWN route to
        `_mark_downloaded_locked` (a `done >= total` reading) fires on very
        little in practice, because uv's LAST redraw of a row measures short
        of the total even for a genuinely finished one — a real capture's

#
# Package-level progress (above) still leaves a venv dominated by one huge
# wheel — the ROCm/CUDA torch install this whole feature shipped to fix —
# reporting nothing for however long that single file takes, because there
# is no SECOND package landing to move the aggregate. Measuring uv's own
# cache-directory growth for that was investigated once already and
# dropped: it tracks UNPACKED size, several times the compressed transfer,
# with no single file to stat as "bytes so far" (see `_UvProgress`'s
# docstring for that finding, still true and still why this is not built on
# the cache directory).
#
# What changed is where to look instead. uv only prints per-package IN-FLIGHT
# bytes when it believes stdout is a terminal — pointed at a pipe it never
# announces anything between "Downloading" and "Downloaded" for one file, but
# under a pty (confirmed empirically: `pty.openpty()` + a real `uv sync`,
# transcript captured with per-chunk timestamps) it redraws a live multi-line
# bar, ANSI escapes and all, e.g. — after stripping the escapes:
#
#   Preparing packages... (0/2)  numpy   ------------------------------  6.31 MiB/15.94 MiB
#                                 scipy   ------------------------------  6.14 MiB/33.68 MiB
#
# — refreshed every few milliseconds while the download runs, which is
# exactly the missing signal. uv prints NO "Downloading"/"Downloaded" lines
# at all once it is on a tty (also confirmed empirically) — the live bar
# replaces them, it does not supplement them — so `_PtyProgressReader` below
# feeds the SAME `_UvProgress` through a second entry point
# (`feed_pty_progress`) rather than a parallel one, and the plain-line parser
# (`feed`) stays exactly as built: it is what still catches
# `Resolved`/`Prepared`/`Installed`, which uv prints identically either way.
#
# **The separator between a redraw and a PERMANENT line is a CR, not an
# LF.** A real capture, replayed byte-for-byte, is instructive here: 31,631
# bytes for a two-package sync carried 277 carriage returns and only 7
# newlines. uv's actual shape is one CR-separated frame after another,
# with a permanent line reached by one more CR before the LF that finally
# ends it. `_PtyProgressReader` therefore splits on the CHARACTER CLASS
# (either separator), not on LF alone — the bug that shipped first split
# only on LF, so the reconstructed "line" was the entire multi-KB redraw
# history glued to whatever permanent text followed it, which none of the
# anchored regexes below ever matched: `phase` stuck at `downloading`
# forever, confirmed by replaying the capture.
#
# POSIX only, and optional even there. `pty` does not exist on Windows —
# guarded at import time above — and pty SETUP (not the sync itself) can fail
# on a POSIX box with no `/dev/ptmx` available (a locked-down container,
# some CI sandboxes). Either way this must never be the reason an install

    `_PTY_PROGRESS_RE`'s in-flight byte rows and handed to the ORIGINAL
    line-based parser (`feed`).

    **The split happens on RAW BYTES, before decoding or ANSI-stripping —
    not the other way around.** An earlier version decoded and stripped
    PER READ, then joined the result with the text carry: `text =
    _ANSI_RE.sub("", raw.decode(...)); buf = self._carry + text`. Both a
    UTF-8 multi-byte character and an ANSI escape sequence can straddle a
    `read()` boundary — a pty's kernel buffer is only ~4KiB, so a read
    truncates there whenever uv outruns the reader — and decoding/stripping
    before the halves are ever rejoined leaves the torn piece unfixable: a
    replayed real failure capture at 4KiB reads left 11 bare ESC bytes
    sitting in decoded text that `_ANSI_RE` could no longer recognise as an
    escape (its other half was in the PREVIOUS read, already stripped), and
    one of those leaked straight into the ring as `'\\x1b[1B'` between a
    permanent line and uv's own diagnosis. Splitting on the raw bytes first
    is safe because neither a CR nor an LF byte value can occur INSIDE a
    valid ANSI CSI sequence or a UTF-8 continuation byte (both are
    restricted byte ranges that exclude 0x0D/0x0A) — so accumulating raw
    bytes until a real separator appears, and decoding only once a
    complete, separator-delimited fragment exists, cannot tear either one.

    Only GENUINE, permanent lines are returned for the caller's ring buffer
    (SPEC PY-18's verbatim-error contract) — a live-redraw fragment (a
    download-bar frame, an install-bar frame, either spinner) is chrome,
    identified inline below, and must never reach it: a bounded ring
    flooded with near-duplicate redraws is how a real resolver failure's
    own diagnosis gets pushed out by
    `_STDERR_RING_LINES`, or arrives mid-way through a single multi-KB
    "line" that is mostly bar frames — both measured against real captures
    before this fix.

    treats the two identically once either has returned.

    Raises `_PtyUnavailable` only for a SETUP failure before `uv sync` is
    spawned (`pty.openpty()` itself failing — no `/dev/ptmx`, an exhausted
    pty allocation), which is what makes falling back to `_run_uv_piped`
    always safe: the child never started, so there is no risk of running uv
    twice. Once the child IS running, any exception here is genuine (kill,
    WAIT — matching `_run_uv_piped`'s own discipline, since `kill()` alone
    leaves the reap to nobody while `install()` writes the error record —
    then re-raise). It does NOT fall back, because a second `uv sync`
    racing the first one's still-live process would be worse than the
    original failure.

    `stdin=subprocess.DEVNULL`, not the slave fd: uv's bar keys off
    stdout/stderr, so stdin being a real terminal buys this feature nothing.
    What it WOULD cost: anything in the sync that reads stdin (a prompt uv
    decides to show, a subprocess of its own) blocks forever, because
    nothing on our side ever writes to the master — and neither this loop's
    `poll()` nor `proc.wait()` below carries a deadline that would notice.
    `DEVNULL` makes such a read fail immediately, exactly as it did before
    this feature (a plain pipe with `stdin=DEVNULL`) — a behaviour change
    here would be a regression nothing about the pty NEEDS.

    `close_fds=False`, matching every other spawn in this file (see
    `_acquire_python`): the child inherits an extra, unused copy of
    `master_fd` as a result, which is harmless — it is closed the moment the
    child exits — and consistency here is worth more than trimming one
    inherited descriptor `close_fds=True` would also cost the posix_spawn
    path on a system without `POSIX_SPAWN_CLOSEFROM`.

    `select.poll()`, not `select.select()`: `select()` raises `ValueError`
    for a watched fd at or above `FD_SETSIZE` (1024) — reachable here, since
    this worker inherits whatever fds the server process already had open
    (progress files, sockets) and a pty adds two more on top. `poll()` has
    no such ceiling. This is not a defensive nicety: the ORIGINAL version of
    this loop treated that `ValueError` (and any `OSError`) as "stop
    watching" and broke out silently, still WAITING TO BE FIXED at the time
    of writing — `master_fd` closes underneath a live `uv sync`, its next
    write fails EIO, it dies, and `_build` raises "Failed to build the

def _writable_dir(path):
    """Can a file actually be CREATED in *path*? Answered by doing it.

    `os.access(path, os.W_OK)` is the obvious call and it is the wrong one. On
    Windows it reports the read-only ATTRIBUTE, which is meaningless for a
    directory: an ACL-protected `C:\\Program Files\\FusedRender\\...` answers
    "writable", `_sync_root` then runs the sync in place, and uv dies with
    `Access is denied. (os error 5)` — the exact platform the mirror exists to
    cover, silently mis-answered. POSIX has a smaller version of the same hole:
    `os.access` consults the mode bits, so a directory denied by an ACL entry or
    by SELinux also reports writable.

    A probe answers the question that is actually being asked ("can uv put
    `uv.lock` here"), because it IS that operation. `O_CREAT|O_EXCL` so it can
    never truncate something of the user's, and the pid in the name so two
    installs probing one folder at once cannot collide on it.

    The cleanup objection does not survive contact: a probe file we managed to

def _sync_root(project_dir, venv_dir):
    """Where `uv sync` runs: the project dir, or a writable MIRROR of its manifest.

    `uv sync` WRITES to the directory it runs in — it puts `uv.lock` there, which
    is the whole point for a user's folder (the lock is source and gets
    committed). A project dir that cannot be written to therefore fails the sync
    outright, with uv's own `failed to write to file .../uv.lock: Read-only file
    system (os error 30)` and no environment built.

    That is not a hypothetical: the AI runner folders (`fused_render_app/ai/runners/*`)
    ship INSIDE the app, and the app's own tree is read-only in the shapes it is
    normally installed in — the AppImage runs from a squashfs mount, and a Windows
    install under `Program Files` is not user-writable. Every model download on
    those builds died here. A user's folder on a read-only mount (a mounted
    archive, a `ro` network share) is the same failure.

    So: when the folder cannot hold uv's output, the sync runs in
    `<venv_dir>.src` instead — a mirror holding the declaration, uv's own
    configuration beside it, and nothing else (`_MIRRORED_NAMES`). The venv, the
    cache and the interpreter are unchanged, so the environment built is the same
    one; only the directory uv is allowed to litter moves.

    That the mirror is enough to resolve from is a claim about the folders this
    exists for, not about every folder: the AI runners and the templates are
    `[tool.uv] package = false`, so nothing outside `pyproject.toml` and uv's
    config beside it takes part in resolution. A read-only folder that DID declare
    a `build-system` (uv would build and install the folder itself, from sources
    the mirror does not hold) or a `[tool.uv.sources] {path = ...}` relative
    dependency (which the mirror would resolve relative to itself, i.e. nowhere)
    would resolve differently here than it does in place. That is a stated limit
    of this fallback rather than a silent one; the alternative is copying an
    arbitrarily large read-only tree on every build.

    The mirror is NOT wiped between builds, and that is what makes it worth
    having: the `uv.lock` uv wrote there on the first build is still there on the
    next one, so a rebuild of a bundled runner resolves against the versions the
    first one picked instead of re-resolving from PyPI. Source still beats derived
    — a lock the project itself ships overwrites it, and so does the manifest.

    But a kept lock has to EXPIRE, and the manifest is what expires it. Bare
    `uv sync` re-resolves only what the manifest invalidates, and a widened
    ceiling invalidates nothing: the documented pattern in those runner manifests
    is a pre-1.0 ceiling (`mlx-lm>=0.31,<0.32`), so a release that widens it to
    `<0.33` still has the locked 0.31.x satisfying the range. The rebuild would
    reinstall the identical versions and the deliberate upgrade would never
    happen — packaged builds behaving as if a lock had been committed and never
    refreshed, while a dev checkout (writable folder, no lock, re-resolves every
    time) picked the new one up. Exactly inverted from what those manifests say
    they are relying on.

    So the mirror's own copy of `pyproject.toml` is read as the record of what its
    lock was resolved AGAINST: bytes equal means the lock still describes this
    declaration and is kept (which is the rebuild-after-repair case the mirror is
    for), bytes different means the declaration moved and the lock goes. The
    manifest copy IS the state — no separate marker file to write, fail to write,
    or leave behind.

    Names the source no longer has are removed from the mirror, `uv.lock` alone
    excepted (there the mirror is the only copy that ever existed). Without that,
    a release that drops a runner's `.python-version`, or withdraws a `uv.lock` it
    used to ship, leaves the withdrawn file governing every later build forever —
    a read-only folder cannot be edited to undo it, and the file is somewhere the
    user will never look.

    Writability is a question about the DIRECTORY and it is asked by probing, not
    by `os.access` — see `_writable_dir` for why that distinction is the
    difference between working and not on Windows.

    """`uv sync` the project into `venv_dir`; returns that venv's interpreter.

    `tracker` is a `_UvProgress` that every line of uv's stderr is fed into as
    it streams, for a heartbeat elsewhere to read concurrently — `install()`
    is the only real caller and always passes one. It defaults to a
    throwaway instance rather than being required so every existing direct
    caller of `_build` (this module's own tests, mainly) keeps working
    unchanged; nothing reads a tracker nobody handed in.

    An UNMARKED existing venv directory is PROBED, not removed on sight: the
    D212 failure this guards is a venv whose recorded base prefix no longer
    exists, which `uv sync` would happily leave in place because the packages
    inside it are already correct — but a missing marker is no longer taken as
    proof of that on its own. Since the venv's own location is now the project's
    `.venv` (`projectenv.venv_dir_for`), a folder with no marker is just as
    often a venv a developer built by hand — `uv sync`, `uv venv`, a plain
    `python -m venv` run in their own project — with dev-group packages,
    editable installs and manually `uv pip install`ed extras that this worker
    has no business deleting. `_venv_runs` (this module's own restatement of
    `envinstall._venv_runs`, per D152) answers "does the directory's own
    interpreter start at all": a False destroys it (the D212 case — `uv sync`
    below then rebuilds it from scratch), a True leaves it in place for `uv
    sync` to reconcile (the adoption case), and an inconclusive probe leaves it
    alone too, on the same "do not act on a non-answer" discipline `_venv_runs`
    documents. `envinstall.is_installed` is what unlinks the marker that puts a
    venv in this unmarked state to begin with.

    Environment, not flags, for the two directories, because uv reads both itself
    and a flag would only cover the invocation we remember to put it on:

      UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT  `venv_dir` is always stated explicitly rather than
                              left to uv's own default resolution, even though for
                              the common in-tree case (`projectenv.venv_dir_for`
                              already answered `<project_dir>/.venv`) that happens
                              to be the same path uv would have picked on its own —
                              worth setting anyway, because the one case this
                              worker cannot tell apart from here still needs it: a
                              read-only in-package runner folder cannot hold a
                              `.venv` at all, so its build has to land in the home
                              store instead (D376). A staged core template's
                              folder is writable and takes the in-tree path like
                              any other project; a release-time re-stage wipes its
                              `.venv` along with the rest of the staged tree, and
                              the rebuild is a hardlink relink from the uv cache
                              (which lives outside the staged tree) rather than a
                              re-download — an accepted cost, not a reason to
                              route it through the home store (D630).
      UV_CACHE_DIR            set ONLY when `uv_cache_dir` is not None — which is
                              only when the caller asked for isolation
                              (`FUSED_RENDER_HOME`; see `projectenv.uv_cache_dir()`).
                              Ordinarily left UNSET, deferring to uv's own default
                              cache rather than a sibling of the venv store: an
                              explicit sibling used to be unconditional and
                              fragmented per branch/worktree as a result — the
                              trade `uv_cache_dir()` documents and accepts.

    `UV_LINK_MODE` is deliberately NOT set either way: uv already prefers
    hardlinks and degrades on its own, and pinning it here would override a
    user who had a reason to choose otherwise.

    It runs in `_sync_root(project_dir, venv_dir)` rather than in `project_dir`
    itself — the same directory in every case a folder can be written to, and a
    manifest-only mirror when it cannot (the bundled AI runner folders, on every
    build whose tree is read-only). See that function.

    A bare `uv sync`, with no `--frozen`. That is not a relaxation of
    reproducibility — uv uses an existing `uv.lock` as-is whenever it still
    matches the manifest, and re-resolves only the parts a manifest edit actually
    moved. Which is exactly the required behaviour: nothing changed means the
    committed versions, and a dependency added to `pyproject.toml` is picked up
    automatically. `--frozen` was here at first and had to go: it turns a
    manifest edit into a hard "the lockfile is out of date" error instead of
    reconciling it, and the whole point of the folder rule is that a user never
    has to run `uv sync` by hand (doing so would create an in-folder `.venv` and
    diverge from the home-dir store). Without a lock at all uv resolves and
    WRITES one, which is how a folder gains reproducibility by being run once.

    `allow_build=False` (the default) adds `--no-build`, which fails resolution
    outright rather than letting uv fall back to a source build for a
    dependency with no matching wheel. Static detection
    (`projectenv.nonstandard_dependencies_of`) can only read the manifest — it
    has no way to know a plain `foo>=1.0` happens to publish no wheel for this
    platform until uv actually tries to resolve it, and a source build runs
    that package's OWN `build-system` backend with no consent asked for it.
    `--no-build` turns that into a clean resolver error the client can catch
    and re-offer as an explicit "install anyway" (`runtime.js`'s retry to
    `/api/env/install` with `allow_build: true`), rather than a build silently
    proceeding with no consent asked for it.

    `--no-install-project` rides along with `--no-build`, not on its own: uv's
    `--no-build` forbids building ANY sdist-only distribution, and the LOCAL
    PROJECT ITSELF is one such distribution the instant it declares
    `[build-system]` at all — which a bare `uv init` scaffold does by default
    (`uv_build`), with zero dependencies of its own. Without
    `--no-install-project`, `--no-build` therefore fails EVERY such folder
    outright ("can't be installed because it is marked as `--no-build` but has
    no binary distribution", naming the project itself, not a dependency), and
    that failure's wording does not match `NO_BUILD_HINT` in runtime.js, so no
    "Install anyway" retry is ever offered — the folder is permanently stuck.
    Verified against real `uv 0.12.5`: a fresh `uv init` folder fails on
    `uv sync --no-default-groups --no-build` alone, and succeeds with
    `--no-install-project` added; a folder with a genuinely wheel-less
    dependency (`uwsgi`) still gets refused, and the refusal still carries the
    `hint: Wheels are required for ...` line `NO_BUILD_HINT` matches, so the
    retry path is unaffected.

    The trade-off this accepts: the project's own package is no longer
    installed editable into the venv, so a SRC-LAYOUT folder whose scripts
    `import mypkg` (relying on that editable install to put `mypkg` on
    `sys.path`) would lose that import. Flat-layout script folders — the norm
    here, and what PY-16 describes — are unaffected: Python already puts a
    script's own directory on `sys.path`, with no editable install involved at
    all. A src-layout project that wants its own package importable would need
    to either declare it as an ordinary dependency (so uv builds *a* wheel for
    it, not skip the build) or run `uv sync` by hand outside this app.

# The resolver's OWN wording for "this can only be satisfied by building from

# (the default) refuses uv permission to do so. Detected HERE, in the worker
# that actually knows `--no-build` was passed, rather than by the client
# regexing uv's stderr after the fact (that used to live in runtime.js's
# `NO_BUILD_HINT` — moved here so there is one detector, not two that can
# disagree). See `_build`'s own `--no-build` comment for why the flag exists;
# the two wordings below are transcribed with their reasoning intact.
#
# Anchored on the hint line rather than the "Because … has no usable wheels"
# line above it: the hint is the one sentence uv writes FOR THIS SITUATION
# SPECIFICALLY (it names `--no-build` itself), where the other line's wording
# changes shape between "all versions of X" and "X==1.2.3" depending on
# whether the requirement carries a pin — one pattern to keep in sync with
# uv's output instead of several.
#
# Verified against a real `uv sync --no-build` failure (uv 0.12.5):

# prints while it is still resolving the dependency graph — but `_sync_root`
# deliberately preserves `uv.lock` across builds, and a folder gains one just
# by being run once. Once a lock exists, resolution succeeds against it and
# the refusal happens later, at INSTALL time, with no hint line at all:
#
#   error: Distribution `uwsgi==2.0.31 @ registry+https://pypi.org/simple`
#   can't be installed because it is marked as `--no-build` but has no
#   binary distribution
#
# Verified against real uv 0.12.5 (`uv lock && uv sync --no-default-groups
# --no-build --no-install-project`). The package name sits before the
# `==version @ source` — `[^`=]+` stops at the first `=` so a name is never
# captured with its pin attached. The second group captures everything
# between `==` and the closing backtick — uv writes `X==1.2.3 @
# registry+https://…` inside them, so `_no_build_pinned_version` (below)
# still has to trim the ` @ source` suffix off itself; the hint wording

    The DETACHMENT is done here rather than by the spawner, and that is not a
    style choice: `subprocess.Popen(start_new_session=True)` forces CPython off
    `posix_spawn` onto `fork()+exec`, and the spawner is the SERVER process,
    where PROJ is resident — its `pthread_atfork` child handler closes a stale
    SQLite handle and the forked child dies of SIGSEGV before it ever reaches
    this file (D277's crash; see `envinstall._spawn`). Called from the child,
    a few milliseconds later, it buys exactly the same thing with no fork.

    First statement of the run, before any record is written and long before uv
    is started, because it is `envinstall._kill`'s `killpg` that reaches that uv
    — and `_kill` only signals a group whose leader is this pid.

    EPERM means we are already a process-group leader, which is the same end
    state; anything else here is not worth failing an install over, since the
    only thing lost is the tidiness of the teardown.

    a directory named nothing to create and point `UV_CACHE_DIR` at, and the
    `acquire_python` slot would have this worker try to download a Python
    version called nothing on every ordinary install.

    `allow_build` is not that idiom — argv already gives every slot a string,
    so there is no "missing" case to disambiguate — it is just truthy/falsy on
    the literal text: `"1"` for True, `""` for the (default) False.
