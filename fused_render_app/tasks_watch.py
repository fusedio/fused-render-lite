"""Change detection for the Tasks page — WHICH sessions moved, and a number
that says something did.

The Tasks listing (server/routers/tasks.py) is already cheap to rebuild: every
transcript read is incremental and skipped outright when the file size has not
moved. What it never had was a *signal*. The page asked every 20 seconds, and a
session started (or resumed) in a terminal outside the app surfaced up to a poll
later. This module is that signal.

Claude Code writes two things this can watch, both verified on a real
machine (2026-08-27):

* ``~/.claude/sessions/<pid>.json`` — one file per RUNNING ``claude`` process:
  ``sessionId``, ``cwd``, ``status`` (busy / shell / waiting / idle),
  ``updatedAt``. Rewritten on every status change and deleted when the process
  exits. A resumed two-week-old session gets a file under its OLD session id.
* the transcripts themselves — but only the ones the registry says are live
  are watched here (a couple of dozen files, not the machine's whole history).
  A session nobody is running cannot grow.

`~/.claude/history.jsonl` is NOT one of them, though it was for a round: a
chat sent from this app runs ``claude -p``, and ``-p`` never appends to it.

Stat-poll on a daemon thread, once a second, rather than FSEvents/inotify:
cross-platform, no ctypes, no dropped-event semantics to reason about, and
~25 ``stat`` calls per second is nothing. A real filesystem stream can replace
``_loop`` later behind the same two exports — ``generation()`` and ``wait()`` —
without the router or the page noticing.

What no file can say in time is that a turn has JUST started. A ``claude -p``
run writes its registry row two to four seconds after the process starts, so
the listing called every one of this app's own turns "done" for its first
seconds — and a short turn for the whole of it (Akshil, 2026-09-15). The send
is the earliest signal there is, and the page that made it says so directly:
``mark_running`` (``POST /api/tasks/running``). It is a short-fused FLOOR under
the liveness reading, not a status of its own — the registry takes over the
moment it appears, and the mark expires by itself either way.

Everything here degrades to "no news": an unreadable directory, a half-written
registry file, a vanished transcript all produce no keys and no exception. The
20-second full listing is still there underneath and remains the truth.

    Records `turn` in `_mark_turns` — the floor `mark_idle` measures a LATER
    idle call against, so a follow-up turn's mark cannot be retired by an
    idle that names the turn before it.

    `text` is the words that were sent and `file` the target they were sent
    about. Both optional, both purely DESCRIPTIVE — nothing about liveness
    reads them — and both kept only for as long as the mark is (`sent_marks`,
    `_expire_marks`). They are what the Tasks row draws while the transcript is

    The other half of `mark_running` (`POST /api/tasks/idle`): the page that
    sent a turn is also the first to know it landed — the final result, a
    stop, an error — which is sooner than a registry row disappearing and far
    sooner than the mark's own TTL. Retiring the mark here is what makes a
    three-second turn read `done` in about a second instead of wearing a
    running ring for the rest of `MARK_TTL_SEC`; the TTL remains the safety
    net for a page that never gets to call this (closed tab, lost network).

    Everything the mark carried goes with it — the words, the target, the
    corroborating sighting, the client turn — because all of it described THAT
    send and none of it outlives the send (`_marks`).

    Idempotent and announced whether or not a mark was actually standing —
    the caller is reporting a fact about the TURN, not asking whether the
    watcher had an opinion, and a duplicate or late call must cost one bump
    and nothing else, the same contract `mark_running` keeps.

    Records `turn` in `_last_idle_turn` (keeping the newer of the two, in case
    a stale idle call ever arrives out of order itself) so a `mark_running`
    that shows up afterward claiming that turn or an earlier one is recognized
    as the late half of the turn THIS call already closed, not a new one —
    see `mark_running`.

    `turn` is ALSO compared against `_mark_turns`, the reverse of that same
    race: `noteTurnIdle` awaits its seat's `mark_running` POST before firing,
    which delays the stand-down rather than ordering it, so a FOLLOW-UP turn's
    `mark_running` can still land first. Without this check, this call would
    retire that newer mark — a stale idle standing down a turn that has not
    happened yet — and the row would read `done` until the registry (or that
    turn's own eventual `mark_idle`) caught up. A `turn` that is older than the
    mark currently standing is dropped whole for `_marks`/`_mark_busy_seen`
    (the live mark is left exactly as it was); it still updates
    `_last_idle_turn` when it is the newer value there, so a `mark_running`
    later claiming that same stale turn is refused by `mark_running`'s own
    check, and it does not bump — nothing observable changed."""

    """The queue manager's own word that this session's TURN just ended —
    `POST /api/tasks/queue/event` (`turn_ended`/`exited`), the session host
    reporting a `result` row it tailed off `out.jsonl`. Sooner and more certain
    than anything this module infers on its own: the registry row can go on
    saying `busy` until Claude Code next rewrites it, and a bare transcript
    tail is still inside `session_liveness`'s window for the closing records
    the CLI has not finished writing.

    Unlike `mark_idle` — the SENDING page's own account of a turn it started,
    racing its own `mark_running` on a client `turn` token — this caller has no
    turn of its own to race: it is reporting a fact about a turn from OUTSIDE
    the send/idle pair entirely.

    `at` is WHEN THE TURN ENDED, not when this HTTP call happened to arrive:
    the session host stamps it the instant it saw the `result` row's edge (or,
    for `exited`, the instant it saw the child gone), and the endpoint
    (`queue_events.py`) forwards it through unchanged. A caller with nothing
    better — a test, or a host old enough to predate this — leaves it `None`
    and gets the arrival time, exactly the old behaviour.

    Bugbot: "ended mark clobbers overlapping turns". A `result` row's own POST
    can lose the race to events that are, in truth, LATER than it — a
    follow-up's `mark_running` landing first, or the registry being rewritten
    `busy` again before this slow HTTP call gets here — because none of them
    share a clock with the arrival order of requests at this process. `at`
    fixes that: it is the one thing every caller agrees on independent of
    delivery order, so ordering by `at` rather than by "whichever call reached
    this function first" is what stops an older turn's ended event from
    retiring a newer turn's mark.

    Two effects, both keyed off `at` rather than `time.time()`:

    * `_ended[session_id]` is stamped to `at` — but NEVER BACKWARDS. An event
      whose `at` is not strictly newer than what is already on file is an
      older or duplicate delivery (the one retry `session_host._send_event`
      can produce, or an `exited` arriving after the `turn_ended` for the same
      edge) and changes nothing at all — no stamp, no mark touched, no bump.
    * the live SENT MARK (`_marks`), if any, is retired only when it describes
      THIS turn or an older one: `mark["at"] <= at`. A mark stamped AFTER `at`
      is a follow-up send that already landed — a fresh `mark_running` for a
      later turn, or a corroborating `busy` sighting recorded before this slow
      event arrived — and popping it would be exactly the bug: the listing
      would read the session idle for the rest of a turn that is still
      running. Left alone, `is_turn_ended` sees it directly
      (`mark["at"] > ended_at`) and answers "not ended" for as long as that
      mark stands, which is the correct outcome without this function having
      to know anything about WHY the mark is newer.

    `run_id` is accepted because the endpoint has it on hand and nothing else
    needs it yet; not stored.

    THE ONE NEEDS-ATTENTION FACT NOTHING ELSE ANNOUNCES. `_status` reads
    `needs_attention` off `_parked_runs()` — a scan of the runs tree for cards
    with no decision — so the lane is correct on every listing and up to a full
    poll late in arriving, which for the one status that means "a person has to
    come and do something" is the worst possible latency.

    It has to be watched from HERE, and that is not a style choice. The card is
    WRITTEN by `permission_server.py`, an MCP server the CLI spawns, and it is
    ANSWERED by `agent._decide`, which runs in the executor's subprocess
    (`executor._run_python` — the claude agent is deliberately not on the
    in-process allowlist). Neither is this process, neither may import
    `fused_render` at all (SPEC PY-15 / D166), so neither can call `notify`.
    What both DO is write a file into the run's `perm/` directory, and this
    process can see that for the price of one `stat`.

    So: the newest `PERM_SCAN_LIMIT` run dirs, one stat each, and a session id
    only for the handful whose directory actually moved. A run's FIRST sighting
    is a baseline and announces nothing — `_start` creates `perm/` empty before
    the CLI can raise anything, so the baseline always lands first, and treating
    a new run dir as news would ring on every spawn for a card that does not
    exist.

    Best-effort throughout, like every other read in this module: no agent
    module, no runs tree, an unreadable meta — all mean "no news", never a dead
    watcher.
