"""Signing Claude Code in, by letting the CLI's own browser flow do the work.

`claude_health.py` establishes that the CLI is installed and NOT signed in;
`claude_install.py` repairs the two states that are a download away. This is the
third repair, and it was the one that looked impossible: `/login` is a TUI slash
command, so the advice the strip shipped with — open a terminal, run `claude`,
type `/login` — really is the only route through that door.

**There is a second door, and it does not need the code pasted anywhere.**
`claude auth login` is a plain subcommand that runs TWO flows at once:

* it opens the user's browser at ``http://localhost:<port>/callback``, a
  loopback listener it binds itself, and completes the sign-in when the redirect
  lands there; and
* it PRINTS a different URL — ``https://platform.claude.com/oauth/code/callback``
  — with a "Paste code here if prompted >" prompt, as the fallback for a machine
  whose browser cannot reach it (ssh, headless, a browser on another device).

Same authorization behind both: identical `state`, identical `code_challenge`,
two redirect targets, whichever completes first. On a desktop app with the user's
browser on the same machine the loopback path is the normal one — so THE APP
NEVER HANDLES AN OAUTH CODE. That is the whole reason this module is small.

**Do not read the printed URL and open it.** It is the paste URL; opening it
forces the user into the manual flow for no reason. The loopback URL is never
printed — the child hands it straight to the browser — so there is nothing here
worth capturing, and the child opens the browser itself, which is the one thing
that works on all three platforms (`BROWSER` is a POSIX convention; macOS and
Windows shell out to `open`/`start` and ignore it).

**Why this is not a third `claude_install` action.** Those two are machine time:
they run to completion on their own, so the record is progress and the endpoint
is fire-and-forget. This waits on a PERSON — it will sit at that prompt until the
watchdog kills it — so it needs a cancel, and it must never occupy the shared
install slot while it does. `canvases.py` already solved exactly this shape for
`fused login` (a CLI that opens a browser and blocks on its own loopback
callback) and the structure below is deliberately that one: a live child under a
lock, a watchdog, and a client that polls until the health snapshot says signed
in.

**Success is never inferred from the exit code.** The child exits on failure too
(`Login failed: …`). The authority on whether this worked is the one the rest of
the module already defers to — `claude auth status`, reached through the refresh
endpoint the strip calls anyway.

#: canvases.LOGIN_CHILD_TIMEOUT, and for the same reason: this is a person
#: finding a browser window, reading a consent screen and probably a password

#: browser it sits at the paste prompt indefinitely — so this is the only thing
#: that ends an abandoned attempt.

#: closing and the process record going away.

#: `_Login.tail`.
_OUTPUT_TAIL_LINES = 40

#: Read granularity for the drain. Deliberately an `os.read` on the raw fd, and
#: that is not a micro-optimisation — it is the only form that works here.
#:
#: Both buffered forms deadlock against this child. `for line in stdout` blocks
#: holding the paste prompt, which never gets a newline; `stdout.read(n)` blocks
#: until it has n CHARACTERS, and the child prints its ~700 and then waits on a
#: human indefinitely. Either way the drain returns nothing until the child dies,
#: which is exactly when its output has stopped being useful — the
#: `Login failed: …` line would be captured only after the record had already
#: fallen back to a generic sentence. `os.read` returns what one syscall got.
_READ_CHUNK = 2048

#: The child's stdin prompt, stripped out when deriving an error.
#:
#: STRIPPED, NOT SKIPPED, and that distinction was a bug. The prompt carries no
#: newline, so whatever the child says next lands on the SAME line: a real
#: failure arrives as `Paste code here if prompted > Login failed: Request failed
#: with status code 400`. Dropping every line that mentions the prompt therefore
#: threw away the diagnosis along with it, and the record fell back to quoting
#: `Opening browser to sign in…` as the reason the sign-in failed.
